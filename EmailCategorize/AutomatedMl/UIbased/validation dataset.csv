IncnnLONDON Dow Jones The Netherlands is emerging as an important testing nground for EU gas liberalization as new trading hubs for competitive nshortterm gas supplies from the UK and Norway emerge on the Belgian and nGerman borders nHowever much remains to be done A group of large energy users and traders nis preparing to confront Gasunie Thursday in a hearing organized by the nregulator The main issues of contention are the balancing system which nGasunie conducts on an hourly basis the extent to which transport tariffs nare costfocused and thirdparty access to storage facilitiesnThe emergence of competition in the Dutch gas sector is mostly due to the ninitiative of new market entrants who despite a difficult regulatory nenvironment have managed to develop a market for shortterm gas virtually nfrom scratch nIf liquidity improves in these emerging hubs the Netherlands could become an nimportant transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other ncountries in northwest Europe as well as being an important market in its nown right However the difficulty of implementing transparent thirdparty naccess systems in the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany casts a dark ncloud over recent progress in competition nSince December Enron Europe Ltd UENE Duke Energy Corp DUK EOn AG nEON RWE AG GRWE and Electrabel SA BELE have been actively buying and nselling gas sourced in the UK the Netherlands and Norway in a number of nhubs between Emden in Germany and Emshaven and Oude Statenzijl in the nNetherlands nDavid Gallagher head of European gas trading at Enron in London estimates nthat at least one trade a day of around 100000 therms for a quarterly ncontract is done at the Oude Statenzijl hub where the Gasunie pipeline nsystem connects to the network of Wingas GmbH nAn important element kickstarting shortterm trading was the sale in nDecember 2000 of a 2 billion cubic meter a year Norwegian gas supply ncontract to five Dutchbased power generators nRobert van der Hoeven head of fuel procurement at Electrabel the owner of nDutch generator EPON said his company uses most of the gas it imports from nNorway for its plants in the Netherlands and trades the rest on a shortterm nbasis in the OudeEmden area This pattern is common to the other Dutchbased nparties to that contract nTrading in Dutch hubs received a further boost when Nederlandse Gasunie NV nNNEG decided after months of wrangling with regulator DTe to lower its ntransport tariffs by 65 from January 2001 and to unbundle its combined ncommodity and service tariff the socalled CSS system from July 2001 nGasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent To nprove this it says it has lost 30 of its customers in the eligible market nbut that figure hasnt changed much since March 2000 Small wonder that ncritics say the switching figure doesnt necessarily indicate an ideal system nof thirdparty access nAccording to energy consultants The Brattle Group around half of the gas nused by alternative suppliers goes through the 1 bcmyear Zebra pipeline from nZelzate to Zeeland which was built by Dutch utilities a few years ago nprecisely because Gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms nShippers have complained that the hourly system used by Gasunie to balance nthe pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network nsignificantly Gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces nshippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites nin addition to the capacity and transmission price Critics say Gasunie has nso far failed to unbundle these charges although it agreed to do so in nJanuary nAccording to the Brattle Group another controversial aspect of Gasunies ntariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new npipelines rather than its actual costs nThe DTe is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it ncompetitive BP PLC UBP and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij NV operate nstorage facilities and lease capacity to Gasunie through longterm contracts nThe regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage nfacilities Gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more ncompetitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to ncustomers critics say nThe growth of shortterm trading in the Dutch gas market is also inevitably nlinked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the nUKBelgium gas interconnector and going towards the 82bcmayear German nmarket nMarket participants say liquidity at the Emden and Oude hubs has grown nconsiderably since EOn and RWE started trading there earlier this year nHowever the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward thirdparty access nthere has meant that so far most gas traded in the Netherlands has remained nthere nBy Germana Canzi Dow Jones Newswires 44 20 7842 9283 ngermanacanzidowjonescomnnCopyright  2000

generators are nstill owed for electric production in October while PGE has paid only a nsmall percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment nin early January nThe plants onethird of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and nsolar power meet almost 30 of Californias electricity needs Almost all of nthe closed generators are fueled by natural gas and many havent been able nto pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply nThe California Senate Energy Committee plans to vote on legislation to create na new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week The proposed nbill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about 17 cents a nkilowatthour the past eight months to about eight cents depending on the nprice of fiveyear naturalgas contracts the generators can sign The plants nthat run on renewable resources would be paid 54 cents a kilowatthour n Mark Golden contributed to this article nWrite to Jason

Kelly Katie KaplannCc IEP Board of DirectorsnFrom Julee MalinowskiBall Edson  ModisettenRE Legislative Status Report Week Ending 223nnnRECENT EVENTSnn The week started off on a very positive note  Monday was a holidaynTuesday however inevitably came along to spoil all the fun with lastnminute committee hearing announcements for some significant billsnn SB 39x Speier was heard this week in the Senate Energy Committee  Thisnmeasure would define owners or operators of any electric generating facilitynas a public utility subject to the statex01s jurisdiction  The bill alsonplaces the CPUC in the role of determining scheduled maintenance outages forngeneration units  Although the bill goes much further the authorx01s onlynintention is to give the CPUC a role in coordinating power plant outagesnbut seems to not understand the implications of doing it in the mannernoutlined in the bill  IEP opposed the bill and testified to that end alongnwith CMTA the State Chamber of Commerce Enron WSPA and the CalifornianCogeneration Council  The usual cast of consumer groups supported the billnOf particular note during the hearing was the hostility shown to thenopposition by the Chair of the Committee Senator Bowen  The message fromnthe opposition clearly was ignored by the majority of the members as itnpassed out of the committee on a partyline vote  IEP is currentlynreassessing its strategy on this particular issue because this is not thenonly bill that proposes similar changesnn The Assembly Natural Resources Committee chaired by Asm Howard Waynenwas scheduled this week to hear two siting bills  The first was AB 34x LanSuer which would make various changes to the CEC siting process includingnsome IEPsponsored language  IEP has a support if amended position on thenbill which has some technical and policy problems but workable  Lastnminute amendments offered by Asm Keeley forced Asm La Suer to postpone anhearing on the bill until next Monday 226  However because the Keeleynamendments basically gut the current language and turn it into a study billnLa Suer is unlikely to accept them and according to the negative committeenanalysis the committee is unlikely to approve the measure in its currentnformnnAB 36x Wright on the other hand passed the Natural Resources committeenwith only one x01nox018 vote  AB 36x would provide expedited siting for anrepower project as defined  However despite IEPx01s efforts to get the billnamended the current language would help few if any repower projects  Thenauthor has agreed to continue working with us the environmental communitynand the CEC to develop language that works for everyone  IEPx01s major issuenat this point is that is should actually work  The measure was doublenreferred to the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee and will benheard there nextnn The negotiated language on the QF issue finally has a vehicle SB 47xnBattin  All stakeholders are not united in their complete support for thenmeasure  IEP has may need some additional changes but will be mobilizingnmembers on Monday to educate Senators on the bill and support the measure innthe Senate Energy Committee when it is scheduled for a hearing  Both SCEnand WSPA also have some outstanding issues but only WSPA so far will benopposing the billnn SB 6x Burton which would establish and state power and financingnauthority passed off the Senate Floor 24 to 14 this week and is headed tonthe Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee next IEP met withnSenator Burtonx01s staff this week to talk about amendments to SB 6x relatingnto limiting the Authorityx01s eminent domain powers  Staff was open to whatnwe had to say but we have little confidence our recommendations will movenforward with

7265 MWs The FERC has investigated nthese outages and found no improprieties just that the plants are overtaxed nfrom running at higher than normal capacitiesnn2  There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1244 MWs of projected nsupply from reratingrestarting existing thermal and renewable projects  It nis very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer nif at all  As evidenced by the email I sent out this morning local ncommunities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units  In addition nthese units are likely to be uneconomicalnn3  In the existing resource pool there are roughly 1430 MWs of peaking or nother generation units that are running up against their operating hour nlimitations from air quality regulations  The Governor has ordered the local nair quality districts to address these restrictions  We are beginning to nseem some movement however the US EPA has yet to weigh in on these relaxed nstandardsnn4  The distributed generationbackup generation capacity to make up some of nthe shortfall is still an unknown  While there has been some relaxing of the nlimitations on run hours for backup generation at essential

rate increases accross nthe west nnhttpwwwlatimescombusinessreportspowerlatwest010226htmnBack to storyn n nMost of West in the Same Power Jam as Californian Utilities Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations nswelled and few new energy sources were developed Now also facing nblackouts they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and ntoward themselvesnnnBy PETER G GOSSELIN Times Staff Writernnn     WINTERSBURG ArizFor more than a century California ran a simple naccount with the rest of the West It demanded and the West supplied most nespecially water and powern     But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decadein no small npart because of an outbound trek of Californiansthis simple supplydemand nrelationship has broken downn     Fundamentally the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system njust as California has its own And it has done so in very much the same nwayby adding too many people without enough new power or conservationn     Indeed statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have nbeen on the verge of trouble even without Californias help and may yet face nthe sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden nStaten     The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that nits planning reservesthe extra power that utilities build in to handle nemergencieshave shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts nconsider dangerousn     Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production nat anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade nDespite the long economic boom of the 1990s which smiled especially on the nWest several such as Arizona have failed to complete a single new power nplantn     We dont know how bad its going to be yet said Utahs Republican ngovernor Mike Leavitt We wont know that until May June July and August nwhen everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolersn     In trying to dodge the blackout bullet many Western leaders are seeking nto force a great change on the region to renegotiate their states basic ndeal with California They want to end an old relationshipthat between ncenter and hinterland colonizer and colonizedand establish a new one that ncould curtail Californias long regional dominancen     In the strange chemistry of the momentwhen a onceRepublican state ngovernment has turned Democratic and a onceDemocratic national government nhas turned Republican when the battle is to a large extent over privately nowned electricity rather than publicly controlled waterthey could actually nmeet with some successn     California spent the 20th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street nand the East said Kevin Starr the state librarian and author of a nmultivolume history of California Now all of a sudden theres a dramatic npossibility of it being recolonized at least in part by the rest of the nWestnn     Captive Plants Feed Power to Californian     Ground zero for these changes lies 50 miles west of Phoenix in the dry nscrublands of Wintersburg This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility nnow the nations single biggest power producer It will soon be home as well nto between three and six new gasfired power plants that combined will nproduce even more electricity than their giant neighborn     Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old fraying world of nregulated utilities and about the supplydemand relationships that California nonce maintained with the rest of the Westn     More than onequarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles municipal nutility the Department of Water and Power several other California cities nand Southern California Edisonn     A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California carrying a ntransmission line from plant to consumer California has big stakes in a nhalfdozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New nMexicon     From Californias point of view the beauty of these projects has been nthat they provided nearcertain power without the muss of meeting state npollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to homen     And at least until the mid1990s California regulators virtually nguaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits even if nplants power wasnt immediately neededn     The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to nmeet demand no matter what said Paul L Joskow a veteran utility neconomist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technologyn     If you had too much power if it cost you a little too much that was nless important than being sure you could meet demand And he added you nhad regulators watching to make sure you didn     The gasfired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also nrepresentative but of the new deregulated world of power production nAlthough they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same nCalifornia transmission line they are being built on an entirely different nbusiness premise selling power to the highest biddern     In fact the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an nelectricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself but its huge ntransmission lines In addition to the California line four others fan out nfrom the plant two back to Phoenix one east to New Mexico and one north to nUtah and from there to the Northwestn     All were built to hardwire the nuclear project to its owners But they nare now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar nby sending power wherever prices are highestn     It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the nmarket to see if they could meet demand said Jack Davis president of nPinnacle West Capital Corp which owns Arizonas major utility and is nputting up two of the Wintersburg plantsn     Now he said approvingly its being built by people who look at the nmarket to see if you can make a lot of moneynn     Plans Go Awry in Many Statesn     Money not the watchful eye of government was what was supposed to nassure that electricity deregulation worked The opportunity to make it would ncause investors to flock to the electricity business ensuring that plenty of nnew power plants got builtn     If too many went up it would be investors not ratepayers who nsuffered If too few then high prices would attract still more investors nmore plants and ultimately more powern     But to date almost nothing about deregulation has gone as plannedand nnot just in California but in the West in generaln     Take Arizona The state has a handsoff attitude toward business nincluding its utilities It has almost none of the environmental restrictions nblamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needsn     Its population grew by 40 from 1990 to 2000 according to the Census nBureau And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate naccording to industry figuresn     Arizona should have been a power producers heaven said A Michael nSchaal a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc a prominent nWashingtonarea consulting firmn     But Arizonas power production rose a mere 4 during the 1990s mostly nas a result of improving existing plants Until 18 months ago no one had napplied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late 1980sn     I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort nof 10 20 30year time horizon Arizonas Republican Gov Jane Dee Hull nsaid in a recent interview I think what we all worry about is Are they nplanningn     Or Nevada Its utilities apparently did plan and increased nelectricitymaking capacity between 1990 and 2000 by a substantial 44 But nthat wasnt enough to keep up with the states population which increased n66 On Thursday Nevada Gov Kenny Guinn a Republican and former energy ncompany executive indefinitely halted deregulation in his staten     Or traditionally energyrich Washington state One of its major nutilities Seattle City Light recently learned that all of its previously nplanned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed and then nsome by just three new customers computer server farms being built to nhandle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the hightech capitaln     But its unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional nsupplies are balanced on a razors edge according to Northwest Power Pool nPresident Jerry Rust We have no cushionn     Indeed the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a nrazors edge with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this nsummern     Schaal the Washingtonarea consultant for example said the region nwill come up 6 short Westerners can expect 150 to 275 hours of rolling nblackouts most of them in California he saidn     One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that in ncontrast to what most people think supplies have not grown short just nrecentlyn     They have been perilously tight for the last several yearsbefore the nstart of Californias troubles of this summer and fall and before the nnearrecord dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water nfor its hydroelectric damsn     The implication is that California did not cause other states to run nshort of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger It did nthat according to key observers with one monumentally inept maneuvern     When California required its major utilities to buy power in the nvolatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along nhigher costs to consumers it set off a furious price spiraln     That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security nblanket the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively nif local supplies proved inadequaten     The result has been a string of crises across the Westn     In southern Arizona for example the San Carlos Irrigation Project a ntiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by ndropping longterm contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the nspot market has announced that its bills are going up 300 Most of the nprojects 13300 poor customers say they cant payn     In Phoenix utility executives who had confidently said the state was nrich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two n50yearold steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable ngenerators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot marketn     In Idaho the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip nplanting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps nback to the firm Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than npurchasing power on the open marketand the potato farmers are likely to do npretty well themselvesnn     Deep Hostility in Rest of the Westn     The subtle difference between Californias triggering recent events and nactually causing the regions crisis is largely lost in the current natmosphere of apprehension and upheaval Although leaders of the rest of the nWest are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big nneighbor they are less guarded at homen     The normally mildmannered Leavitt for example was recently quoted as nwarning a Salt Lake City audience that California if given the chance nwould put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly In an ninterview he denied having made the remarkn     Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners nthat their states are in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto plundered nprovincesterrain that first Easterners and then Californians have nregularly raided for minerals water and most recently powern     But this time some Western leaders think they can change all this A nlot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with nCalifornia to their advantage said Stanford historian Richard Whiten     The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the Westn     In the Northwest Oregon Washington Idaho and Montana are redoubling ntheir efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration the huge nfederally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that nis one of Californias chief sources of summer electricity n     The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the nregion can be exported without the regions consent Oregon Gov John nKitzhaber said in an interviewn     In Arizona state officials have gone from having no proposals for new npower plants to being buried by them Regulators recently approved the nconstruction of 10 plants including several around Palo Verde and are nconsidering another eightn     Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizonas nneeds first the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for nwhatever prices they can command an arrangement that could leave California njust one among many biddersn     Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way Gov Hull is close to nPresident Bush who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic nCalifornian     Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah nwhere Leavitt is trying something that could become Californias worst nnightmarerecalling power that Utah produces for the staten     Los Angeles DWP and several other California utilities own nthreequarters of the huge coalfired Intermountain Power Project in nwestcentral Utah and have been drawing on it without incident for 15 yearsn     But Utah officials recently unearthed a longforgotten provision in ntheir agreement with the plants owners that gives them the right with nproper notice to recall power for local usen     The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back 50 nmegawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another 170 next summer nand it may be able to take back still more according to plant general nmanager Reed Searlen     Although the amounts are trivialthe Los Angeles utility either owns or nhas firm contracts for more than 7000 megawatts of capacityLeavitt said nUtah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants nin the state including a 500 to 750megawatt facility that Los Angeles is nnegotiating to buildn     California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has ndepended on us to do that the Utah governor said Thats fine and were nwilling to do thatn     But he added there comes a point at which if demand grows too nlarge weve got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves and for nour children and grandchildrenn     If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point California ncould be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which nit now suffersnnn n     Times researcher Lynn Marshall in Seattle contributed to this reportnnCopyright 2001 Los Angeles Times  nnn nn  n n n,1

three stations in the naltiplano have been shut down bled off and lockedx01 Other supervisors nthroughout the system have been advised and are on alertnn Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shutdown and ninspection action planx01 We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE the nregional electricity distributor under which they will redistribute energy nout of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPazx01  this should cover LaPazs nelectricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our ninspectionx01 The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in nLaPazx01 Weve agreed that they will slow down their operations and provide nonly small local supplies industrial concrete demand will be shutinnn We did not send a press release on the issue although we have received ninquiries  our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivians nthis action presented and we are performing an inspection on the systemx01 We nare avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time due to the nvolatility of the issue in LaPazx01 Government VMEH SIRESE has agreed with nthe messagenn We expect that with the cement plant and power plant

instructing gas consumers in the area how to nsafely shutdown and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes nnecessarynn The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales  a local nrevolutionary tied to the coca trade  is behind the actionx01 Morales has had ncontact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina Oruro so nwere still not sure whether this was an act

agenda is national  theyve never isolated TR or our industry as a nwhole although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past probably nbecause they have a field in the middle of Morales

into the situation with the understanding that if this is the result of nan organized movement they might have access to intelligence that could be nhelpfulnn Additionally weve shut down all

can benefit McMahon said by entering into a multiyear nphysical off take with Enron thus giving steel mills a degree of certain nvolume and on product specification Enron would guarantee purchase of a

could benefit immediately The only way ndistributors are able to hedge themselves is to go out and buy inventory nhe explained That takes capital and cash and space We can offer a nfinancial product

that how it moves forward will be interesting If they just nmove forward with hedge instruments    thats independent of whether you nrun your business well by having a good supplier that matches up with the ndemands of your customers I think Enron will be a good thing for some npeople and a nonevent for othersnttBeyond hedging McMahon pointed out firm and enforceable contracts could nbecome a key benefit to service centers As one Midwestern distributor source ncommented One of the terrible things that happens in our business is that nend users demand longterm pricing beyond what anybody can foresee When nthey anticipate the market is going up or that it has hit a low point they npush harder for itas any one would But historically they dont honor the ndeals nttIn a down market he explained customers demand lower prices Noncompliance ncan result in orders but no releases and a dont call us well call you nattitude from customers The consequence for service centers he said are nprice reductions on the way down and on the way up If Enron brings nintegrity to both sides of this market he concluded that would be a very nbig plus for the steel industrynttBut integrity another Midwest service center exec countered has got nothing nto do with it In his estimation Enron is like a profiteering carpetbagger ntrying to make a buck in between the producer and the user Thats all

fruit of the steel market in the current economy nWhat do you think the mills are going to do when you come to them for just nthe peripheral items he queried My concern would be that the price would ngo up on those itemsnttMcNeeley also questioned the wisdom of distributors relinquishing control of ntheir inventories In distribution 60 percent of our net worth is ninventory 30 percent is accounts

not that distributor in effect surrender its own nsovereigntynttOnly just begunnQuestions abound regarding Enrons role as a physical supplier of steel as nwell As one Minnesotabased service center exec put it are they ready to ndeal with problemsnttAlthough Enron has expressed interest in being a physical supplier Dave nLerman explained I think thats going to be a lot more difficult to nimplement Enron would have to consider specific qualities coil sizes nnuances of chemistry surface quality and formability Most customers nrequire better than standard tolerances he pointed out These are all nissues that might complicate commodity salesnttDelivery is another issue As a physical supplier Enron has virtually nguaranteed justintime delivery but as one service center source said the nguarantee is good when the material shows up at my door What happens if it ndoesnt show up I disappoint a customer What good does it do to sue Enron nif Ive lost a customernttMill executives have questioned whether Enron is a potential competitor nThey see Enron as someone likely to buy foreign steel in order to deliver it nto a US customer said Chuck Bradford principal of Bradford Research and na longtime industry observer He cautioned against seeing Enron as too much nof a physical supplier speculating that the future of Enron similar to the nLME will be in hedging You may see some physical transactions to start nwith Bradford predicted just to get the ball rolling But I dont see nthat as the way the market will developnttMcMahon has been consistent in saying that Enron has little interest in nbecoming a steel manufacturer The real value he said is in a transparent nliquid market We know the products work we know the market wants them Can nany one particular mill or mills prevent that We dont think so he said nIts not an if its a whennttThe jury is still out on just how soon that when will come and what those neffects will be for the steel industry And for all of

bThe letter looks good  A couple of comments for your considerationnnOn page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and nthen argue that we dont fit into it  Would it be worth explaining why that nmakes sense  Specifically the New Jersey restructuring law like most nefforts of its kind in other markets is designed to separate the competitive nfrom monopoly elements of the power and gas businesses  Economic nregulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the nbusiness eg distribution  The competitive market can not be solely relied nupon to regulate the behavior of monopoly asset owners such as ndistribution utilities  Therefore regulators continue to be called upon to nset pricing and other terms of service  What those regulators decide matters na great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for nlawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign ncontributions to tacitly influence decision makers  The same public policies nsimply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive  The ngeneration and sales business has a competitive structure ie relatively nlow barriers to entry multiple competitors etc  These components of the npower and gas business can be regulated by the market with respect to rates nand terms of service  They do not require economic regulation any more than ngrocery stores department stores appliance sellers or other retailers nwho presumably are not prohibited from making contributions  Competition nand markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of nservice  Because regulators dont set the prices and terms of service for nsuch sellers there is no reason to be concerned about campaign ncontribuitions from such organizations  Indeed the legislation and the nlegislative history clearly conform to this underlying policy rationalenAs a former practicing lawyer I certainly understand the value of pleading nin the alternative  But I question how certain of our arguments woud be nperceived by the public if they ever came to light which these documents nhave a habit of doing   I can just see the press seizing on Enrons claim nof ignorance or mistake or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise nof prosecutorial discretion  I suggest that we add whatever we feel is nnecessary to the very solid looking intent argument not make specific nreference to ignorance or mistake and not plead for the favorable nesxercise of PD  If we feel we need to write about this last item perhaps nwe could suggest that it would be a waste of the publics resources to pursue na claim under such circumstances,1

states lights on nGenerators need to be held accountable he said nThe crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages yet npower companies say these caps force them to sell power at belowmarket rates nduring periods of high demand nSome companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the nexpense of shipping electricity from state to state Each mile that nelectricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost nNo ones going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps said nGary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an nenergyindustry association in Menlo Park nAckerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no neconomic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls nare in effect nThis means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up not nhaving enough Ackerman said It increases the threat of blackouts nBLACKOUT ALERT CANCELEDnCalifornia authorities issued a blackout alert at 145 pm yesterday when npower reserves dipped to dangerously low levels They canceled the alert nabout an hour later after finding additional supplies nEveryone in the West is fighting for megawatts said Stephanie McCorkle a nspokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator which oversees nthe states power network nThe Golden States latest brush with lightsout conditions came a day after nNevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time prompting nheavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to

what role the federal price limits may have had in nexacerbating Mondays shortage nWere looking very closely at this he said There seems to be a potential nfor unintended consequences nSpecifically Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older less nefficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking if not vanishing nunder capped prices nWere going to see how the caps might have played into this he said nThe federal ceiling in 10 Western states excluding California is about 92 nper megawatt hour In California a 10 percent surcharge is added because of nthe states credit risk

at the Department of Water Resources nUnfortunately it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue nthat they took up only with the greatest reluctance For months federal nregulators

by the federal governments new controls on electricity prices ngenerators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state nwas nearly plunged into rolling blackouts state officials said nThe confusion began when the states electric grid operators declared a Stage n1 power alert in the early afternoon triggering the price caps for the first ntime since they went into effect June 21 nOutofstate generators pulled about 1500 megawatts of electricity off the ntable at midafternoon enough to power about 11 million homes because of nuncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy nRegulatory Commission pricing system said Oscar Hidalgo spokesperson for nthe state Department of Water Resources The department buys electricity for nthe states financially distressed utilities nThey didnt understand what they were going to be paid there was confusion nover the FERC order Hidalgo said We saw 1500 megawatts disappear nThe problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West which forced nCalifornia to compete with other states for scarce electricity he said nRolling blackouts hit southern Nevada nMost California officials credit the FERC system which is based on a nvariable price cap with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power nmarket But power generators have complained that the price caps by limiting nprofits could discourage the production of critically needed electricity nAnd as Mondays episode suggested even the uncertainty about where the cap nwill fall could lead to unexpected shortages nThats the risk that you run with price controls said Arthur ODonnell neditor of the newsletter California Energy Markets People want any kind of ncertainty at all nHidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of lastminute imports nfrom the Bonnex0fville Power Administration the federal agency that markets ngovernmentproduced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest The state nwent into a Stage 2 power alert the nexttolast level before blackouts are nordered The alert was canceled in late afternoon nThe blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8 nFERC imposed a roundtheclock ceiling on power throughout the West The nprice fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the leastefficient nplant operating in California during a power alert declared by the nIndependent System Operator which runs the states powertransmission grid nWhen theres no alert prices cant exceed 85 percent of the cap that was nestablished during the latest alert nUntil Monday the maximum price held steady at about 101 a megawatthour in nCalifornia But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early nafternoon signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 npercent of demand confusion set in Hidalgo and others said nBecause of a steep drop in the price of natural gas which fuels many nCalifornia power plants suppliers knew the cap would fall But no one knew nby how much until the price was posted by the ISO nThe ceiling for California fell to about 77 at 3 pm but was back up to 98 nin two hours according to the ISO Those prices include the 10 percent npremium that sellers can charge California because FERC said theres a credit nrisk in selling to the state nODonnell said its likely suppliers will pull back from the market every ntime the ISO declares a power alert nInstate generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO But noutofstate suppliers can withhold supplies and on Monday it was the noutofstaters that were pulling back Hidalgo said nnThe Bees Dale Kasler can be reached at 916 3211066 or dkaslersacbeecom nnnnnnPower Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs nElectricity Confused suppliers unsure what they will

California triggers the setting of a new price limit that napplies to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona nThe new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run the nmost inefficient expensive power plant selling electricity to California ngrid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergencynBut much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price is nsupposed to be established under the commissions order and that apparently ndrove away sellers Hart saidnShortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 130 pm putting nthe old price limit of 90 per megawatthour in question companies that had ncommitted to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon nbacked out Hart said The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of nOregon Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading a unit of nthe San Diegobased energy conglomeratenForced to dip even deeper into the states power reserves and declare a nStage 2 emergency water agency officials called the federal energy ncommissions hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and nwhen it should take effect They got no answernHart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to nclarify their order today One outstanding question is what obligations power nsuppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergencynBoth buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price when it nis set will probably be lower than 90 per megawatthour because the price nof natural gas the main fuel in California power plants has dropped latelynTemperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators nhad anticipated But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in npart because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland Ore had nagreed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower neach hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California

bThanks for your message I do think we need to talk this through  In the nmeantime though lets not make anymore VPs until this is resolved  As I nsaid in my original message I am not looking to undo what has been done but nto make sure we dont do it again unless the process is followednn I understand that there are significant title differences across the regions nwe operate  In fact one of the people in my organization who did not make nVP is Dennis Vegas who has done an extraordinary job in Latin America  nNotwithstanding his regional focus and the significance of a VP title in his nregion he was put through the company wide process and he David Haug and I nsubmit everyone else on the Exec Comm understood that every new VP would go nthrough the same process regardless of regional assignment with the nexception of certain joint venture companies But I maintain that we need nsome consistency in the VP title in particular  ie that it remain an nEnronwide title granted only through the PRC process  Though I dont npersonally feel this way for many people in the organization the VP title nmeans something separate from the compensation structure it implies nsomething like making partner in a legal or consulting firm Making that ncut should not vary based on where you live or what region you supportnn I also understand the point about needing a certain title for external npurposes  In my organization we are dealing with very titleconscious nelected officials and media  I can make the case for every one of my ndirectors and senior directors that they would be more effective externally nif they carried a more senior title regardless of any change in ncompensation  As an executive committee we elected to make such an nexception only for legacy title holders  ie people who had previously nmade VP outside the process  Everyone in my organizationnnnTo Cindy OlsonENRON Steven J KeanEESncc Sanjay BhatnagarENRONDEVELOPMENTENRONDEVELOPMENT nSubject Job Titles and Job BandingnnFrom reading the emails on the issue regarding Regional Vice President at nEnron India it sounds like there will be more discussion on this issue I nknow that issues like this generally come up at the Enron ExCom level There nare a few issues that need to be kept in mind and although Cindy and I have ndiscussed these in the past I have not had an opportunity to pursue them nfurther but would be happy to help out on this I have noticed these not nonly in India but also in the other international settings where I have nworked for Enron during the past several yearsnn1 International job titles and domestic job titles do not correlate For nexample in India the title Director implies a very senior person within nthe organization well above VP whereas in the Enron domestic world it is na position below VP Managing Director within Enron is below the most nsenior levels but in India a MD is the Ken Lay equivalent For this reason nI cannot use Managing Director in my title or on my business card although nthis is my title for Enron Houston purposes nn2 Job titles are much more important in an international setting than in a ndomestic setting For example in Houston we have people at the director nand probably manager level who lead deal teams and bring deals to nsuccessful closing In an international setting particularly India to get nto the decisionmakers in your counterpart organization an officer title of nVP or above is very often required To a certain degree this is form over nsubstance but thats what works over herenn3 To solve some of these problems Enron should consider doing what some nother international companies have done and I think Cindy and her team may nalready be working on this A job banding study should be done and based on nresponsibilities everyone globally should be placed in a band It would not nbe a title band of VP or director or manager but rather a band with a nnontitle classification I hate to suggest a band with numbers such as 1 nthrough 15 because that sounds way too much like the government but nsomething like that would work Once this is done communication is made to nemployees that the band is what is key in determining their compensation and nlevel within the organization Then the business units can rely on their nparticular market dynamics or on what their competition is doing to determine njob titles Thus if the Global Origination group needs to have a title of nSenior Trader and EECC needs a title of Project Leader and Enron India needs na Regional Vice President all can be accomplished while keeping these same npeople at a consistent level for global Enron purposesnnI will be happy to discuss this further with any of you Plus I will nvolunteer to participate in finding a solution that works for all of Enron nwhile taking into account  the specifc business unit andor global function nneedsnnWadenn,1

whichnreduced Enrons stake to 50 percentnn  For years the plant has been the site of many nonviolent protestsnn  The project has met with opposition from local people andnactivists from elsewhere in

arrest according tonAmnestys report Amnesty found that another pregnant woman wasnbeaten and several other women sustained injuries includingnbruising abrasions and lacerations on arms and legsnn  Amnesty said the police involved in suppressing protests includednthe Special Reserve Police SRP on the site of the company Itnadded The involvement of the SRP in the harassment of protestersnindicates the need for the three US multinationals participatingnin the joint venture to take steps to ensure that all the managementnand staff of the DPC Dabhol Power Companyin particular anynsecurity staff subcontracted to seconded to or employed by thencompanyare trained in human rights and are fully accountable forntheir actionsnn  A January 1999 investigation by Human Rights Watch came to anstronger conclusion Human Rights Watch believes that the DabholnPower Corporation and its parent company Enron are complicit innthese human rights violations it said The company undernprovisions of law paid the abusive state forces for the securitynthey provided to the company These forces located adjacent to thenproject site were only stationed there to deal with protests Innaddition contractors for DPC engaged in a pattern of harassmentnintimidation and attacks on individuals opposed to the Dabhol Powernproject    The Dabhol Power Corporation refused to acknowledgenthat its contractors were responsible for criminal acts and did notnadequately investigate condemn or cease relationships with thesenindividualsnn  Enron denies any wrongdoing While we respect the mission of HumannRights Watch we do not feel that its report on the Dabhol Powernproject is accurate says an Enron spokesperson The report refersnto peaceful protests when in fact the reason the police werenpositioned near our site is that there have been many acts ofnviolence against our employees and contractors Dabhol Power Companynhas worked hard to promote positive relations with the communitynUnfortunately the good relationship we have built with a largenpercentage of the community was not reflected in the report Enronnis committed to providing energy and communications services whilenpreserving the human rights of citizens and our workersnn  Enron has also raised a stink in Bolivia with its involvement innthe Cuiaba Integrated Energy Project The project is run bynTransredes Bolivias hydrocarbon transport company which came intonbeing in 1997 after Bolivia privatized its oil sector under theninfluence of the World Bank A joint venture of Enron and Shell ownsn50 percent of Transredes On January 31 2000 a Transredes oilnpipeline erupted and dumped an estimated 10000 barrels of refinedncrude oil and gasoline into the Desaguadero River which supportsnindigenous communities such as the Uru Muratosnn  This problem is Transredess number one priority and we arencommitted to continue to work hard to mitigate the short andnlongterm social and

fish the Uru Muratos left their ancestral lands at the southernnshores of Lake Poopo in April and marched eightyfive miles to thencity of Oruro to ask for government helpnn  We subsequently reached an agreement with them to provide certainnlevels of relief and assistance says Keith Miceli general managernfor public relations for Enron South Americann  In its actions overseas Enron has made a practice of takingnadvantage of corporate welfare And it has enlisted George W Bush innthis effortnn  For example in March 1997 Lay wrote a letter to Bush that wasnsubsequently released to the press under Texas open records lawsnasking him to contact every member of the Texas delegation innCongress to explain how export credit agencies of the United Statesnare critical to US developers like Enron who are pursuingninternational projects in developing countries These agenciesninclude the Overseas Private Investment Corporation OPIC whichnprovides political risk coverage and financial support to USncompanies investing abroadnn  OPIC provided financing or insurance coverage worth almost 300nmillion for Enrons foreign projects just last year according tongovernment records The New York Times reported Enron officialsnhave in the past asked Mr Bush to help lobby lawmakers tonappropriate funds of OPIC as well as for the ExportImport Banknanother federal agency that aids American companies abroadnn  Enron received 200 million in political risk insurance for thenDabhol project in 1996 And it received 200 million in insurancenfrom OPIC in 1999 for its Bolivian projectnn  The Enron Methanol plant in Pasadena Texas lies in the HoustonnShip Channel area the nations largest concentration ofnpetrochemical plants just east of the city The plant has wonnspecial concessions from Governor Bush allowing the company tonpollute without a permit as well as giving it immunity fromnprosecution for violating some environmental standardsnn  Plants like this in Texas cumulatively emit twice as much nitrogennoxide a key ingredient of smog as do all the nine million cars innTexas put togethernn  Only 7 percent of the more than 3500 tons of nitrogen oxidenemitted by the Enron Methanol plant in 1997 would have beennpermitted had Enron not gotten away with this under the grandfathernclause of the 1971 Texas Clean Air Act which allows plants builtnbefore 1971 to continue their polluting practices Bush extendednthis clause under the 1999 Clean Air Responsibility EnterprisenCARE program that his office drew up in a series of secretnmeetings with representatives of the top polluters in the state asnMolly Ivins reported CARE waives permit requirements for plantsnthat volunteer to cut emissionsnn  The CARE program is backed up by an act that Bush signed in Mayn1995 giving sweeping protections to polluters that perform internalnenvironmental or safety audits The law makes these audit documentsnconfidential and allows polluters to escape responsibility fornenvironmental violations To date Enron has conducted five suchnaudits and filed for immunity from prosecution for violations of thenlaw according to the Texas Natural Resources ConservationnCommission TNRCC the state equivalent of the EnvironmentalnProtection Agencynn  Tamara Maschini who lives about five miles from the Enron plantnis one of the founders of a local environmental group called CleannAir Clear Lakenn  Whole families in this neighborhood have asthma because of thenpollution from plants like Enron she saysnn  Mark Palmer head of public relations for Enron says that thencompanys contribution to local pollution is minimalnn  If the grandfather clause was canceled right now we would benefitnthe most of any of the companies in Texas because our nitrogen oxidenemissions add up to less than half a percent of the total he saysnn  Last year the Bush campaign borrowed Enrons corporate jets eightntimes to fly aides around the country more times than any of thenthirtyfour other companies that

bLate this morning the House Energy and Commerce Committee adoped the committee print as amended of an energy package that addresses conservation clean coal renewables hydro nuclear and boutique fuels  The vote was 50 to 5 to report the bill  Other committees  Ways and Means Science and Resources  also moved their energy bills this week  Thus the House is on track to consider a merged package before the start of the August Recess on August 3rdnnAs to electricity during the several days of debate this week both Chairmen Tauzin and Barton reaffirmed their intention to next move to electricity issues  Mr Bartons staff advised me this morning that the subcommittee he chairs will hold a hearing on Friday July 20th on all electricity issues other than transmission  While Mr  Barton has publicly held out hope of marking up an electricity bill this month sources on and off the committee do not see this timetable as realistic  On the Senate side the majority staff is working on an electricity white paper that may be circulated for comment next weeknnBelow is a recap of action on amendments of interest to Enronnn1tLast night on a largely partisan vote with Democrats Hall Green and John voting with the Republicans the Committee rejected an amendment by Rep Jane Harman DCA that was to have been offered by Rep Anna Eshoo DCA that would have retroactively amended the FERC refund date and essentially ordered refunds regardless of amounts owed to power sellersnn2tFirst thing this morning the Committee again on a largely partisan basis with Democrats Hall Green John and Towns rejected a Waxman amendment to impose costofservice rates on all power in the West other than generation added after 1101  Originally Mr Waxman was going to offer amendment to impose costofservice rates only on those who do not supply all available power during an emergency but he ended up offering basically what he had pursued in subcommittee on the old Californa Only billnn3tThe Committee adopted an amendment by Rep Shadegg to amend the Natural Gas Act to make it clear that a natural gas transportation facility shall not be added to the National Register of Historic Places until FERC has abandoned the facility  Apparently there have been some instances of old pipelines being considered as historic places under federal law  The House Resources Committee added a similar amendment to its package yesterdaynn4tBy voice vote the Committee rejected a Waxman Amendment to require the president to propose and implement a plan to bring US greenhouse gases down to 1990 levels  There was strong opposition voiced by many Republicans and Democrats to this amendmentnn5tBy mixed vote of 24 to 29 the Committee defeated a Waxman Amendment to set cost and performance goals for renewables including wind power and authorize federal funds to assist with commercial project costs up to 50 percent,1
bOnce again today I participated in the discussions on possible electricity legislation held in the offices of Majority Whip Tom DeLay with other interested parties including industry segments public power and state regulators  The other congressional participants were staff to Reps Steve Largent and Chip PickeringnnAfter meeting all week except Wednesday the group was unable to reach an agreement or even a provisional consensus on what could be placed in an electricity title that could be added to the comprehensive energy package that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will begin to process next week  Congressional staff will report to their bosses on the status of the discussions as of this afternoon and from there the Members will determine whether to proceed further  There is a general perception that committee leaders will elect NOT to take up electricty legislation at this time and in the context of the broader package in the absence of broadly supported legislationnnIn the end the discussions did not bear fruit because divisions remained over the usual issues and along most of the usual fault lines  As the drafts progressed during the week we succeeded in deleting the original language that would have had Congress weigh into the bundledunbundled and federastate jurisdictional rules at the very time that likely adverse action in Congress could in turn adversely impact the Supreme Court casennA last minute attempt was made by the congressional staff to stitch together a minimalist electricity title that would have included reliability with the understanding that the NERC discussions could produce modifications more to our liking PUHCA repeal PURPA reform interconnection language and federal siting  However in each instance there were one more politically relevant interest groups not willing to go along  Cong DeLays staff also tried to link PUHCA repeal to those who had joined an RTOnnThere was also an attempt to strip it down to reliability interconnection and siting eminent domain  but again there was either disagreement on the details or objection from those who favorite subject was left out of the minimalist packagennThere was one rather interesting discussion when the public power folks floated language on market power that included a sentence that would have made the filed rate doctrine inapplicable to antitrust challenges to market rates  Needless to say I strongly objected as did EPSA and othersnnAs noted the lack of an agreement reduces our exposure when the mark up occurs  In the absence of an electricity title refund price control and other issues should not be germane to the package that the subcommittee will take up on Tuesday and the full committee next Friday  That package will have five issues addressed conservation clean coal hyrdo nuclear and reformulated gasoline  Details to follow once legislative language is released,1
bEarlier today the Senate Energy Committee held the first of two days of hearings on Chairman Bingamans white paper on electricity and the electricity provisions of other pending bills  The hearings will continue tomorrow with all of the five FERC commissioners as witnesses plus private sector witnessesnnTodays hearing went well from our perpective with support for Super RTOs and general support for expanding the grid both physically and from an access view point voiced by Senators and witnesses  Sen Craig Thomas even said four RTOs were too many  there should be one national RTO to run a national grid  Todays witnesses represented the Dept of Energy EPSA EEI NRECA APPA IBEW union Alliance to Save Energy ELCON NERC NARUC NASUCA and the State of New Mexico  We will provide a more detailed analysis after completing a review of the lengthy written testimony but a summary of the DOE testimony and the first panel of private sector witnesses followsnn1tDOE said they are working on electricity legislative language  Should be done soon  Chairman Bingaman said they needed to get it done in time for the Committee to consider it when the Committee takes up electricity as early as the second week in September  Deputy Sec Blake implied that their proposal was or would soon be shared with other Administration agencies for reviewnn2tIn response to questions Blake said that legislative action on jurisdiction questions fed v state would be useful but he stressed that they view any new legislation as clarifying that FERC has authority they feel already exists  He said that while states have an important role to play Congress must recongize the interstate character of the market and the need for open access to the interstate grid  In response to a question Blake later said that FERC had largely addressed the access issue or would do sonn3tOn reliability he was given a chance to say that DOE supports th NERC consensus language but instead repeated that the Administration favors enforceable reliability standards but wants to work with the Committee on the exact language  I took this as confirmation of what we have heard informally from DOE in terms of key players there not being enamored of the NERC consensus approach at least as it exists in its old long formnn4tSens Craig and Cantwell pushed Blake on why the Administration has not fully supported BPAs request for a debt limit increase to finance expansion of the BPA grid  Blake said they support the BPA expansion projects but that OMB feels BPA has enough borrowing authority through 2003  This did not sit well with Craig and Cantwell  I spoke with Sen Craig in the hall following up on a conversation I had with him the other evening about BPA and he stressed that he is committed to getting BPA the debt limit it needs  As you know commercial has asked us to help BPA given matters pending between Enron and BPAnn5tOn the first private sector panel even John Rowe the CoCEO of Exelon and past EEI chairman testifying for his company and EEI said several times that there should be strong RTOs that each cover a wide idea  He said his board voted yesterday to sell its transmission assets IF a strong independent operator could be found  Rowe also said that RTOs should be encouraged implying not mandatory  The APPA witness was strong on RTOs saying that all entities will be part of RTOs even without legislation  NRECA said that coops would oppose federal jurisdiction over them and that they favor voluntary RTOs  EPSA made the usual case for competition open access RTOs etc,1
bnLate last night the House on a 240189 vote passed as amended HR 4  the Securing Amercas Future Energy SAFE Act of 2001  Here is what happened on the three amendments of interest to Enronnnt1tThe House overwhelmingly defeated 154 to 274 a Waxman Amendment DCA  to impose cost of service rates on wholesale sales of electricity in the WSCC for 18 months  Only three House Republicans supported the amendment all from California  Gallegly Issa and Hunter 57 Democrats opposed the Waxman Amendment including all of the Texas Democrats EXCEPT Frost Hinojosa Rodriguez and Doggett these four SUPPORTED the Waxman Amendment  Thus our collective lobbying efforts in recent months focusing on California Republicans Texas Democrats and other moderate Democrats worked out in the endnnt2tThe House also overwhelmingly defeated the Cox Amendment RCA to grant California a waiver of the Clean Air Acts oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline  The vote was 125 to 300 44 Republicans 80 Democrats and 1 independent voted for the amendment 173 Republicans 126 Democrats and 1 independent voted against itnnt3tThe House also defeated the Green Amendment DTX to repeal the Natural Gas Acts Hinshaw Exemption as it applies to Californias intrastate natural gas pipelines  The vote was 154 to 275 123 Republicans and 31 Democrats voted for it while 95 Republicans 178 Democrats and 2 independents voted against the amendmentnnPlease call or email with comments or questions  The Senate Energy Committee is starting its work this week on an energy package with consideration of an RD title other issues will be taken up in September including electricity  The House Energy and Commerce Committee will now turn to electricity issues with staff drafting during the August Recess hearings in September and votes on legislation in September or early October,1
bnnLinda requested some background and talking points on the pending RTO letter from Chairman Tauzin to FERC that is sitting on Chairman Bartons desk TODAY for his decision whether to cosign the letter  While we have not seen the text we are told that it is antiRTO and may go so far as to state or imply that FERC does not have authority to do what is doing with RTOs  We know this is the view of one of Chairman Tauzins counsels who formerly worked for Southern Co  Chairman Tauzin has been contacted by Entergy and the Louisiana Public Service Commission to send the letter  I spoke to Chairman Bartons staff Andy Black this afternoon and relayed our concerns  The Barton Subcommittee is now expected to mark up an electricity bill in December per a Republican Member meeting held this morningnnACTION ITEMttCall Rep Joe Barton 2022252002nnTALKING POINTSnnt1tShould start with something about the DynegyEnron transaction it will be strange if Mr Lay or Steve calls nChairman Barton and does not start the conversation with some reference to the transactionnnt2tMentioning the transaction naturally leads into the importance of competitive wholesale markets for powernboth for consumers and for the largely Texasbased marketing trading and merchant power industriesnnt3tWe understand that Chairman Barton has been approached by Chairman Tauzin about a letter to FERC on the RTO issue  We know Chairman Barton is well aware of Enrons strong support for FERCs RTO initiatives  We respect Chairman Bartons interest in seeing to it that Congress does not abdicate its responsibility to make energy policynnt4tIf as we have been lead to believe the letter states or implies that FERC does not have authority to act in the RTO arena this will be seen as a potentially destabilizing development since FERC is so far down the road of creating RTOsnnt5tWhile we understand some in Congress and elsewhere were concerned that FERC was moving too fast as of the last FERC meeting earlier this month that is no longer true even if it ever was true  While we think RTOs should be created sooner rather than later FERC is listening to state regulators and others who had concernsnnt6tA letter from congressional leaders questioning FERCs authority goes too far in the direction of those who oppose any RTOs  Furthermore it is wrong as a matter of law  The DC Circuit held in the gas cases and in the power cases on Order 888 that FERC has authority to address systemic discrimination which is in large part what the RTOs are all about  a remedy for iscrimination,1

LaPaz but continue their inspection  TR will not reinitiate gas or crude export operations until we have completed our inspection  We have formed joint teams with CLHB and Army personnel to perform the inspection  It could take as long as 48 hours but well have a better estimate after we get a progress report in the morning   All crews available systemwide are mobilizing for inspection of the entire system but for now our priority continues to be the lines in the altiplano  The three stations in the altiplano have been shut down bled off and locked  Other supervisors throughout the system have been advised and are on alertnntGovernment and regulator continue to be supportive of our shutdown and inspection action plan  We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE the regional electricity distributor under which they will redistribute energy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz   this should cover LaPazs electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our inspection  The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in LaPaz  Weve agreed that they will slow down their operations and provide only small local supplies industrial concrete demand will be shutinnntWe did not send a press release on the issue although we have received inquiries  our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivians this action presented and we are performing an inspection on the system  We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time due to the volatility of the issue in LaPaz  Government VMEH SIRESE has agreed with the messagenntWe expect that with the cement plant and power plant offline line pack should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days  In either event we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to safely shutdown and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes necessarynntThe most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales  a local revolutionary tied to the coca trade  is behind the action  Morales has had contact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina Oruro so were still not sure whether this was an act against TR andor the industry or if it is against government  Morales has just joined forces with another rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorrow  Their agenda is national  theyve never isolated TR or our industry as a whole although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past probably because they have a field in the middle of Morales stronghold  The political situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political interests looking to fill the leadership void  Were watching this situation closely  The local Army brigade has committed to staying on vigilance for at least the next few days  once were comfortable with the operational situation well discuss a longerterm solutionnntSteve nnt Forwarded by Steve HopperTRANSREDES on 07172001 0637 PM  nntSteve Hopper n07172001 0353 PM n   nTo     nicktombsshellcombr JohannesWalzebuckshellcombr Peter E

station  Our OSSA II crude exports to Chile and GAA gas to LaPaz share the same ROW and would likely have been taken out with the bomb  We understand that the bomb which had a manual fuse did not go off but had been lit and failed to explode  The Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb and we consider the immediate threat neutralizednntHowever given that we have now seen several attempts in the last 10 days of sabotage against our lines I have declared a state of EMERGENCY and will notify the Enron Crisis teamnntWe have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down and have mobilized a joint CLHBTRArmy team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano network  The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go out in LaPaz within the next few hours  the GAA line is their primary power fuel supply  Ive notified all relevant government authorities of the situation and so far am getting support  Ive also asked the Embassy to look into the situation with the understanding that if this is the result of an organized movement they might have access to intelligence that could be helpfulnntAdditionally weve shut down all noncritical maintenance operations throughtout the rest of the system and are directing spare personnel to perform vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible  Until and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the altiplano we will continue operations with all stations on alert  We will kick off the the total system inspection within the next few hours as soon as our people complete the overall plannntI will keep you posted as things develop nntSteve nnnnnnnn,1

distribution system and will interconnect with Guardian Pipeline as well as the NNG system nNorthern Natural Gas is pleased to be a part of a creative costeffective solution to provide additional gas

natural gas supplies from Guardian or NNG Providing reliable economical choices for consumers will benefit all of the parties involved nWe saw this as an opportunity to minimize environmental impact and still realize the benefits of increased competition in the natural gas market said James Schott senior vice president Wisconsin Gas The purchase of the Eagle line will enable Wisconsin Gas to further our goal of providing costefficient natural gas service to our customers nAs a result of the purchase Guardian Pipeline the 141mile interstate pipeline from Joliet Ill to Ixonia Wis will no longer build an 85mile lateral to Eagle The lateral was part of the originally certified Guardian Pipeline This portion of the line would have generally run parallel to the current Northern Natural pipeline nThis sale is a winwin situation for Guardian and consumers said George Hass project manager of Guardian Pipeline The Eagle line purchase by Wisconsin Gas saves Guardian time and resources by taking away the need to build the 85mile lateral and allows all three companies to create a better environment for competition in the natural gas marketplace nThe existing gate stations at LaGrange and Eagle will remain inservice for regulation purposes Odorization and measurement will take place at a new gate station that will be constructed at the interconnect with Guardian This new gate

July 2001    Giant energy concern now turns its attention to steel The companys aggressive posture has begged controversy Industry reactions vary from handwringing to open arms Still others characterize Enron as a nonevent By Michelle Martinez Arjona EditorinChief and Paul Hohl Contributing Editor  These days saying the word Enron in a room full of metals executives is like screaming fire in a crowded theater For most in the steel industry the idea of a futures market is enough to raise a few eyebrows But when a major market maker with annual revenues of 10 times the market cap of the US steelmaking industry stakes a claim for 2000 alone Enron logged revenues of 101 billionthats with a b a lot more than eyebrows are likely to be raised After a bold presentation from Jeff McMahon president and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets at the SSCI annual convention in May in which he accused steel mills of treating their service center customers as annoyances industry leaders rushed to understand this latest market contender  Friend or foe Competitor or partner These are just a couple of the questions surrounding Enrons aggressive push into the metals industry Judging from the service center and mill executives Modern Metals queried there are as many answers as there are opinions in the industry Reactions ranged from fear to acceptance to downright resentment At least one mill was reticent to discuss Enron at allstill others seemed to meet the issue with unaffected shrugs If the saying is true that all publicity is good publicity the buzz that Enron has generated would make even a Hollywood spin doctor envious Whats the hubbub Although products such as natural gas and energyEnrons major business platformhave been traded as commodities for years until Enrons appearance a formal forward market for steel has never existed According to McMahon the absence of a liquid and transparent market has resulted in uninformed investment decisions that have exacerbated the current oversupply situation and left companies exposed to the hazards of price volatility  Enrons answer is to offer a variety of financial hedging products along with forward contracts in hotrolled coldrolled and galvanized plate and long products are soon to follow locking in prices for as many as five years out Enron contends that it can act as a risk intermediary in steel transactions ensuring healthier profit margins and lowering the cost of capital Certain grades of steel are commodities McMahon insists and as such should be bought and sold on a commodity market basis instead of the strategic relationships that now exist between the mills and consumers Enron has been offering steel online and via phone and fax since November of last year Before you add capacity before you make an investment decision youll be able to see a three five maybe even a 10year forward price of steel McMahon stated and if you want to hedge that investment you can do that The company plans to buy steel at a floating price and then sell it to steel consumers at a fixed rate making money on the spread In February Greg Hermans VP of steel trading at Enron reported to AMM that it was offering USmade 10gauge 48in wide hotrolled for April delivery in Chicago for 225 a ton Hermans said Enron was buying the same product for April delivery at 215 a ton  Eventually Enron sees the development of four different marketplaces the Northeast the Midwest or Chicago area the Gulf Coast or Houston area and the West Coast Enron will hedge against spot price spikes through equity and physical holdings in domestic mills The company closed on Huntcos Arkansasbased coldrolling mill in June Its a big portfolio McMahon said We wanted to put together a portfolio of supply and demand In some cases well own assetshopefully well own some term contracts with domestic mills To the extent that imports are a part of the equation well be a part of that market We may purchase capacity from somebody not necessarily the assets but toll slab through a hot strip mill All of those combined is how we do our business Steel mills can benefit McMahon said by entering into a multiyear physical off take with Enron thus giving steel mills a degree of certain volume and on product specification Enron would guarantee purchase of a specified amount of tonnage and use a floating price or a floor price to guard against market shocks Whether mills would be willing to divert capacity to the commodity grades being bought and sold by Enron remains uncertain At least one mill executive privately said no    at least for now Nucor president CEO and vice chairman Dan DiMicco also sees little value in Enrons proposal What we need to have is stable pricing at levels where the most efficient mills can make a good return on their capital and further invest in new technologies and equipment he stated I define true value as helping the industry to become stronger It doesnt do any good to maintain a lack of price volatility at 200 a ton Keith Busse CEO at Steel Dynamics echoed that sentiment in a recent New Steel article If youre trying to get volatility out at 320 per ton great he said But at 230 you want to stick your fingers down your throat For the service centers Service centers McMahon suggested could benefit immediately The only way distributors are able to hedge themselves is to go out and buy inventory he explained That takes capital and cash and space We can offer a financial product that gives the exact same protection but doesnt require any of the above We can hold those inventories and price the steel at the time of delivery to the service centers he continued so their 4 or 5 percent net margins are somewhat certain I do think that Enron is providing a service for the industry     commented Dave Lerman CEO of Steel Warehouse South Bend Indiana But he pointed out that how it moves forward will be interesting If they just move forward with hedge instruments    thats independent of whether you run your business well by having a good supplier that matches up with the demands of your customers I think Enron will be a good thing for some people and a nonevent for others Beyond hedging McMahon pointed out firm and enforceable contracts could become a key benefit to service centers As one Midwestern distributor source commented One of the terrible things that happens in our business is that end users demand longterm pricing beyond what anybody can foresee When they anticipate the market is going up or that it has hit a low point they push harder for itas any one would But historically they dont honor the deals  In a down market he explained customers demand lower prices Noncompliance can result in orders but no releases and a dont call us well call you attitude from customers The consequence for service centers he said are price reductions on the way down and on the way up If Enron brings integrity to both sides of this market he concluded that would be a very big plus for the steel industry But integrity another Midwest service center exec countered has got nothing to do with it In his estimation Enron is like a profiteering carpetbagger trying to make a buck in between the producer and the user Thats all we need right now he declared somebody trying to squeeze out a few more dollars But he recognized were all going to have to deal with it Don McNeeley president and CEO of Chicago Tube  Iron indicated that some good could come of a heavyhitter like Enron introducing new ideas into the industry but acknowledged that people might be offended by somebody picking the socalled lowhanging fruit of the steel market in the current economy What do you think the mills are going to do when you come to them for just the peripheral items he queried My concern would be that the price would go up on those items McNeeley also questioned the wisdom of distributors relinquishing control of their inventories In distribution 60 percent of our net worth is inventory 30 percent is accounts receivable and 10 percent is plant property and equipment he related Our single largest asset is our inventory If a distribution company surrenders control of its inventory to a third party does not that distributor in effect surrender its own sovereignty Only just begun Questions abound regarding Enrons role as a physical supplier of steel as well As one Minnesotabased service center exec put it are they ready to deal with problems Although Enron has expressed interest in being a physical supplier Dave Lerman explained I think thats going to be a lot more difficult to implement Enron would have to consider specific qualities coil sizes nuances of chemistry surface quality and formability Most customers require better than standard tolerances he pointed out These are all issues that might complicate commodity sales Delivery is another issue As a physical supplier Enron has virtually guaranteed justintime delivery but as one service center source said the guarantee is good when the material shows up at my door What happens if it doesnt show up I disappoint a customer What good does it do to sue Enron if Ive lost a customer Mill executives have questioned whether Enron is a potential competitor They see Enron as someone likely to buy foreign steel in order to deliver it to a US customer said Chuck Bradford principal of Bradford Research and a longtime industry observer He cautioned against seeing Enron as too much of a physical supplier speculating that the future of Enron similar to the LME will be in hedging You may see some physical transactions to start with Bradford predicted just to get the ball rolling But I dont see that as the way the market will develop McMahon has been consistent in saying that Enron has little interest in becoming a steel manufacturer The real value he said is in a transparent liquid market We know the products work we know the market wants them Can any one particular mill or mills prevent that We dont think so he said Its not an if its a when The jury is still out on just how soon that when will come and what those effects will be for the steel industry And for all of the debate surrounding the issue it seems a bit soon to be hitting the panic button As Don McNeeley recounted I can recall similar controversy over a speech a guy gave about 1517 years ago That guys name was Ken Iverson and he had this concept called a minimill Look at it now tnnn,1

bThe letter looks good  A couple of comments for your considerationnnOn page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and then argue that we dont fit into it  Would it be worth explaining why that makes sense  Specifically the New Jersey restructuring law like most efforts of its kind in other markets is designed to separate the competitive from monopoly elements of the power and gas businesses  Economic regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business eg distribution  The competitive market can not be solely relied upon to regulate the behavior of monopoly asset owners such as distribution utilities  Therefore regulators continue to be called upon to set pricing and other terms of service  What those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign contributions to tacitly influence decision makers  The same public policies simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive  The generation and sales business has a competitive structure ie relatively low barriers to entry multiple competitors etc  These components of the power and gas business can be regulated by the market with respect to rates and terms of service  They do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores department stores appliance sellers or other retailers who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions  Competition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of service  Because regulators dont set the prices and terms of service for such sellers there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations  Indeed the legislation and the legislative history clearly conform to this underlying policy rationalenAs a former practicing lawyer I certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative  But I question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light which these documents have a habit of doing   I can just see the press seizing on Enrons claim of ignorance or mistake or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion  I suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument not make specific reference to ignorance or mistake and not plead for the favorable esxercise of PD  If we feel we need to write about this last item perhaps we could suggest that it would be a waste of the publics resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances,1

bsee belownnFederal price limits backfire nSome generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps nDavid Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer nWednesday July 4 2001 n2001 San Francisco Chronicle  nURL httpwwwsfgatecomcgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchive20010704MN186091DTL  nOfficials in California and Nevada after months of lobbying for federal regulators to cap Western power prices warned yesterday that the newly imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of blackouts in the two states nThe warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling blackouts yesterday afternoon and one day after the firstever rolling blackouts in Las Vegas forced energyhungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduce air conditioning nThe two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a closer look at the socalled price mitigation plan and come up with revisions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during shortages nWe need some clarity to this order said Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources which is spending billions of dollars to keep the states lights on nGenerators need to be held accountable he said nThe crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages yet power companies say these caps force them to sell power at belowmarket rates during periods of high demand nSome companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the expense of shipping electricity from state to state Each mile that electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost nNo ones going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an energyindustry association in Menlo Park nAckerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls are in effect nThis means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up not having enough Ackerman said It increases the threat of blackouts nBLACKOUT ALERT CANCELEDnCalifornia authorities issued a blackout alert at 145 pm yesterday when power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels They canceled the alert about an hour later after finding additional supplies nEveryone in the West is fighting for megawatts said Stephanie McCorkle a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator which oversees the states power network nThe Golden States latest brush with lightsout conditions came a day after Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time prompting heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their lights nDon Soderberg chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission said that the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in exacerbating Mondays shortage nWere looking very closely at this he said There seems to be a potential for unintended consequences nSpecifically Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older less efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking if not vanishing under capped prices nWere going to see how the caps might have played into this he said nThe federal ceiling in 10 Western states excluding California is about 92 per megawatt hour In California a 10 percent surcharge is added because of the states credit risk bringing the price to just over 101 nAckerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls have extended Californias power crisis to neighboring states nCalifornia sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus he said nLAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES nCalifornia and Nevada officials however said that they still have faith that price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot withhold output nThe generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes in the plan said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources nUnfortunately it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue that they took up only with the greatest reluctance For months federal regulators refused to impose price controls preferring instead to let supply and demand determine costs nHidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back on output Monday California officials immediately dialed the hot line number provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emergencies nNo one answered he said They were closed nState officials tried again yesterday and this time were told that the commission would look into the matter They were not given a time frame for when the commission might come up with a response nEmail David Lazarus at dlazarussfchroniclecom  n2001 San Francisco Chronicle    Page A  1 nnnnnnOutofstate generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controlsnBy Dale KaslernBee Staff WriternPublished July 3 2001 nConfused by the federal governments new controls on electricity prices generators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state was nearly plunged into rolling blackouts state officials said nThe confusion began when the states electric grid operators declared a Stage 1 power alert in the early afternoon triggering the price caps for the first time since they went into effect June 21 nOutofstate generators pulled about 1500 megawatts of electricity off the table at midafternoon enough to power about 11 million homes because of uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pricing system said Oscar Hidalgo spokesperson for the state Department of Water Resources The department buys electricity for the states financially distressed utilities nThey didnt understand what they were going to be paid there was confusion over the FERC order Hidalgo said We saw 1500 megawatts disappear nThe problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West which forced California to compete with other states for scarce electricity he said Rolling blackouts hit southern Nevada nMost California officials credit the FERC system which is based on a variable price cap with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power market But power generators have complained that the price caps by limiting profits could discourage the production of critically needed electricity And as Mondays episode suggested even the uncertainty about where the cap will fall could lead to unexpected shortages nThats the risk that you run with price controls said Arthur ODonnell editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets People want any kind of certainty at all nHidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of lastminute imports from the Bonnex07ville Power Administration the federal agency that markets governmentproduced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest The state went into a Stage 2 power alert the nexttolast level before blackouts are ordered The alert was canceled in late afternoon nThe blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8 nFERC imposed a roundtheclock ceiling on power throughout the West The price fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the leastefficient plant operating in California during a power alert declared by the Independent System Operator which runs the states powertransmission grid When theres no alert prices cant exceed 85 percent of the cap that was established during the latest alert nUntil Monday the maximum price held steady at about 101 a megawatthour in California But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early afternoon signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 percent of demand confusion set in Hidalgo and others said nBecause of a steep drop in the price of natural gas which fuels many California power plants suppliers knew the cap would fall But no one knew by how much until the price was posted by the ISO nThe ceiling for California fell to about 77 at 3 pm but was back up to 98 in two hours according to the ISO Those prices include the 10 percent premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said theres a credit risk in selling to the state nODonnell said its likely suppliers will pull back from the market every time the ISO declares a power alert nInstate generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO But outofstate suppliers can withhold supplies and on Monday it was the outofstaters that were pulling back Hidalgo said nnThe Bees Dale Kasler can be reached at 916 3211066 or dkaslersacbeecom  nnnnnnPower Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs nElectricity Confused suppliers unsure what they will be paid refuse to sell to state which asks FERC for a ruling but doesnt get it nnBy NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writer nn     SACRAMENTOConfusion over new federal price restrictions prompted several electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday afternoon pushing the state closer to blackouts energy officials saidn     The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to supply more than 1 million homes said Ray Hart deputy director of the California Department of Water Resources which has been buying much of the states electricity since Januaryn     At least five companies producing or marketing power are telling us that since they dont know what theyre going to get paid theyre not going to take the risk and so theyre not going to sell the energy Hart saidn     The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in summer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency meaning reserves had dipped below 7 It was the first such emergency since May 31n     Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission intended to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West a power emergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that applies to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona n     The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run the most inefficient expensive power plant selling electricity to California grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergencyn     But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price is supposed to be established under the commissions order and that apparently drove away sellers Hart saidn     Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 130 pm putting the old price limit of 90 per megawatthour in question companies that had committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon backed out Hart said The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of Oregon Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading a unit of the San Diegobased energy conglomeraten     Forced to dip even deeper into the states power reserves and declare a Stage 2 emergency water agency officials called the federal energy commissions hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and when it should take effect They got no answern     Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clarify their order today One outstanding question is what obligations power suppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergencyn     Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price when it is set will probably be lower than 90 per megawatthour because the price of natural gas the main fuel in California power plants has dropped latelyn     Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators had anticipated But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland Ore had agreed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower each hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this summern     Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through Hart said

bLorraine here are a few notes from my review of the Val Verde contract and nmy initial impressions  Lets talk more about how to approach the issue nafter we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOPnn123192 Interconnect AgreementnnSec 13 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to nprovide firm compression service TW will accept up to 200000 on an ninterruptible basisnnSec 2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceedednnSec 42 limits damages no consequential damagesnnThe contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clausenn21893 letter amendmentnnSec 3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept n200000 into TWs system provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and nquantity of at least 140  Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide nfirm compression in accordance with Sec 13 of 1292 agreementnn92595 letter amendmentnnIncreases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250000 once the San nJuan expansion is effectivennMy initial conclusions  It is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept n250000 on a firm basis provided that Burlington complies with the pressure nrequirements  Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if naccepting 250000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP  In that case we can nargue impossibility of performance  Also we could avoid the obligation nbecause the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force nmajeure  This argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to nhave gotten hotter over the years  nnThe fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with Burlington in nJanuary of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments they will say nwe should have known by now  Burlington might try to argue that we have an nabsolute obligation to comply with the agreement even if it means expensive nsystem modifications  That argument is not a very strong one because the nagreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly ndescribes the facilities that are the subject of the agreement,1

bJim nnWill focus on the funding source as one of the issues in the drafts  I assume we would want FERC to have to approve their budget correct  When you say not industry funding  where else would it come from  I assume we dont want to allow the piper to call the tune so to speak based on who pays the bill  My recollection is that in the NERC version of the bill they walled off the funding in a manner we would find objectionable but let me double check that fact,1

nSubject RE NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs nnnChristi nnThis is probably one of the stupidest things I have ever heard  NERC is about as secure as a convenience store at two in the morning  They have almost no experience dealing with security either cyber or otherwise They are using the terrorist attacks on the 11th as a reason to blow the dust off all their old Y2K contingency plans and cash in on peoples fears to strengthen their positionnnIn any case I would suspect that a large RTO with a significant budget is much more likely to be secure than a dues based NERC Look at NERCs offices  They are in a shopping mall  How secure is that  Last time I visited they didnt even have any sort of identity cards or badge system or anything  the whole place was wide open  Anyone could walk in off the street and shut down a large portion of NERCs infrastructure by just randomly unplugging computers  nnContrast that with places like ISONE and NYISO who have significant levels of security in their systems that are extremely sophisticated and complex Or compare that with the MISOs hardened facility capable of withstanding an F4 tornado hit  You tell me whether NERC or RTOs are going to be more securennDave is right on with his classification of the idea of NIMDA being an attack on the electric utility industry as preposterous  Thats akin to saying that a chain letter is an attack on the banking industry because bank statements come in the mail  And Dan points out a more valid thing to consider  a terrorist isnt going to attack a tariff desk market system or security coordinator they will attack nuclear units substations and other installations that actually matter   nnI echo Daves question  do we want to call NERC on this issue  It would be a very simple exercise to point to NERCs many security failings including some initiatives they are currently sitting on  Bringing up the right details in the right forums could really undermine their reputation and nip this positioning in the budnnBy the way  am I the only one who got a kick out of that article pointing out this 3rd grade cleverness of NIMDA is ADMIN spelled backwards  Gotta

NERC made during a recent meeting with members of the national press  The statements concern NERCs view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERCs  Four RTO policy set forth in its July 12th Order  The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization particularly the possibility that NERCs responsibilities could be shifted to EISB  Also attached is an article containing the views of RJ Rudden Associates Inc that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operationsnnSpecifically NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilitiesfrom an information administration standpoint  They noted that this resulted in service denials although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much  This event was attributed to the socalled NIMBA virusnnNERCs statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role theyve played not only in security matters but possibly other aspects pertaining to reliability standards  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERCs July 12th Order  Moreover it is likely that NERC will argue that given its expertise and experience recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization EISB ill advised  nnIt is unclear what if any impact all this may have on RTO development the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Boards consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting  However we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters nnPlease provide your reactions to the NERC statements to Mark Bennett at 2026288200 or mbennettepsaorg n,1
bnThis follows up on Ricks inquiry late last week on the talks between EPSA and EEI on reliability  Yesterday I spoke with Mark Bennett and Donn Salvosa of the EPSA staff  Mark did the talking  The upshot is that EPSA and EEI are meeting to see if they cant agree on reliability legislation  EEI is working off of the NERC draft and has sent a version to EPSA dated 914 see attached that was the basis for last Thursdays meeting  EPSA is now doing some drafting of its ownnnI need to read the 914 draft but the fact that they are working off of the old NERC language is of considerable concern  EPSA staff emphasizes the value of having EEI off the NERC reservation which is good in terms of showing that there is NERC consensus but I think EPSA staff may be too flexible in how they are approaching it  I reminded them of our position and concerns and of Jims prepared statement on EPSAs behalf filed for the Sept 11 Barton hearing  EPSA staff claims that other EPSA members are OK with them embarking on this projectnnIt is not clear if this effort will succeed  EPSA staff said EEIs board insists on having engineers do reliability which is objectionable to EPSA  EPSA staff seems to think that some type of reliablity SRO is inevitable and that it is wise to get the best one they can  I will check with some other EPSA membersnn ,1

bIn our litigation meeting last Tuesday we learned that netting of spot purchases and sales is of paramount importance in limiting our exposure to refunds under the FERCs July 26 Order in both the California and Pacific Northwest proceedings  However in the California proceeding we are also afforded the opportunity in the Order to offset our receivables against any refund that would otherwise have to be paid by us  Also to the extent that our receivables exceed the refund amount the Order provides for payment of interest to us in accordance with CFR Section 3519a  nnAt present I am aware of the existence of three receivables  As you will recall I mentioned at Tuesdays meeting that we should be able to treat as a receivable for purposes of offset the revenues due us from the application of the CAISO underscheduling penalty  I communicated the possibility of offsetting this receivable against any potential refund at this mornings Western Wholesale conference call and subsequent research conducted by Alan Comnes indicates that the CAISO owes us 30MM as per the CAISOs own numbersnnThe CAISO also owes us approximately 40MM due to nonpayment for one to two months of business  These two figures alone totalling approximately 70MM exceed the estimate of our potential exposure in the California proceedingnnFinally the negative CTC issue is another receivable due us by IOUs that under the plain language of the Order could potentially be used to offset any refund amount  I am not aware of the magnitude of this receivable but do understand that there are some sensitivities regarding this issue including concerns about revealing the amount of the credit due us  It is likely that the amount would become public if it is presented in the California proceedingnnPlease give us your thoughts as to the use of the CTC receivable to offset potential refunds in the California proceeding,1

bnnThe Barton discussion draft says that FERCs hands would be tied and that they would have to approve a proposed RTO as to size and scope if the proposed RTO owns or has operational control over transmission facilities that serve at least 40000 MW of load  Southerns CEO testified in Congress recently that their load is over 35000  I assume the 40000 MW minimum would permit the SeTrans proposal to meet the proposed statutory minimum since it is Southern plus a few munis as I understand it  Is this correctnnWho would know how many RTOs there would be if each were just over the 40000 MW minimum  I assume it is much more than 45 RTOs  if so this is a good contrast to use in our Hill effortsnnThanks,1

bnThis note is to report on two electricity legislative developments the Aug 2nd introduction of an antiRTO bill or at least antimandatory RTOs and on a meeting I had yesterday afternoon with Andy Black the policy coordinator for Chairman Joe Barton on the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee to discuss their intentions with respect to electricity legislation this Fallnn1  HR 2814 Reps Tom Sawyer DOH and Richard Burr RNCnnOn Aug 2nd the last day Congress was in session before the August Recess the above named members of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee introduced HR 2814 the Interstate Transmission Act  The legislation is bad because among other things it requires FERC to establish transmission pricing policies that provide incentives for voluntary participation and formation of RTOs with language prohibiting policies that have the effect of forcing transmitting utilities to join RTOs  Also objectionable is that the bill would limit pancaking but at the same time require FERC to establish a reasonable transition mechanism or period for additive charges  The legislation prohibits FERC from conditioning any order upon a transmitting utility being required to transfer operational control of jurisdictional facilities to an ISO or RTO  The bill would require that participating transmitting utilities must approve the form structure and operating entity of any RTOnnIn addition to the RTO language the bill has the old version of the NERC reliability legislation in it  The bill also has a PUHCA exemption for RTOs repeals Federal Power Act sec 203 on the disposition of property and includes the tax changes that IOUs seek for transfers of property to an independent transmission companynnBarbara Hueter advises that First Energy has its hq in Rep Sawyers district  Rep Burr is from North Carolina so perhaps Duke had its utility hat on in working with him  I am checking into where Duke is on this issue  Rep Burr is the Vice Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and close to Chairman Tauzin  so his support for this legislation is significant see Andy Black comment belownn2  Andy Black MeetingnnAndy is meeting with various trade associations this month to discuss electricity legislation  He is only meeting with a few companies on a oneonone basis  Enron Reliant Dynegy and TXU  His timing is to have a legislative draft for Chairman Barton to review when Congress returns after Labor Day  If Chairman Barton approves or makes changes the draft will be circulated to members of the subcommittee and the public for further comment  The intent is to mark up an electricity bill this Fall so that if the Senate acts on electricity in its comprehensive energy bill the issue will be ripe for consideration in a HouseSenate conference committee  Here is a run down of my comments and Andys comments on specific issuesnna   RTOsnnChairman Barton supports RTOs  At a minimum the draft will affirm FERCs authority as the commissioners have requested  Andy is considering going beyond that to mandate RTO participation  Not sure he can hold that position in the subcommittee  He is looking to Enron and others to help them explain and build support for RTOs  Informed him of our initial informal coalition steps  However Andy asked me to look at sec 3 of the SawyerBurr referenced above which I realized after the meeting is the part that deals with incentive rates and negotiated rates to expand transmission and voluntary RTOs  I have a call in to Andy to reconcile these statements since the SawyerBurr bill is based on voluntary RTOs  Hopefully he is thinking of using the incentive and negotiated rate language and NOT the objectionable voluntary RTO aspects  I will strongly encourage him to do the right thing in that regardnnb   PUHCAnnThe draft will use the Pickering bill HR 1101  Told Andy about our concerns with the record keeping provisions of that bill  Will send him our legislative language to clarify these provisions so that they do not open up all of Enrons records  even those unrelated to transactions with a regulated utility affiliatennc  PURPAnnProspective repeal  On back up power they are thinking of requiring that rates for back up power be just and reasonable until there is retail competition in the statennd   InterconnectionnnThey have received a proposal from Trigen that Andy says we will like  I am contacting EPSA to get the detailsnne   Net MeteringnnThey are likely to include the Inslee bill to require net metering  I explained our concern that the bills mandate applies to all retail energy suppliers  including EES  even though this should only apply to utilities with an obligation to serve that it does not make sense to mandate it on service providers like EES per Jims helpful comments yesterday  I need to get more information to Andynnf   Transmission JurisdictionnnThankfully Andy is NOT going to use those portions of the bill as reported by subcommittee in the last Congress that gave use heart burn on jurisdiction  Specifically the draft will not say FERC does not have jurisdiction over the transportation component of a bundled retail sale  the draft will not get into the bundledunbundled issue at all  The draft will bring munis coops and PMAs under the FERC umbrella for transmission jurisdiction purposesnng   SitingnnOn siting Andy is thinking of some type of mechanism that would give a State one year before federal eminent domain attachesnnh   ReliabilitynnOn a negative note Andy intends to use the latest NERC reliability language because NERCs version has strong support among the Members of the subcommittee and no other alternative has emerged with political support ie not PJM  I explained our concerns  He said our best bet is for DoE or FERC to come forward to seek something other than the NERC version  He said Members eyes glaze over on reliability with everything else on the platenni   NegawattsnnI raised the absence of negawatts on his issue list  He said he is open to considering it again but that there was left over political baggage and unresolved issues from when this was attempted during consideration of the California bill earlier this summernnYour questions and comments on the any of the above are most welcome,1
bnJim nnThe quick answer to your question on the Barton bill is that yes it does appear to address this tax issue involving interconnections at least in part  There is language in Title VIII on various tax issues  One of them exludes from gross income certain amounts received by electric utilities specifically including connection fees  In the example in the email the issue was not fees paid directly but assets paid for by the generator that are then transferred to the utility  Will check on that anglennIn any event Title VIII while in the Barton bill is not in the jurisdiction of Bartons subcommittee  Instead the tax title would have to go through the Ways and Means Committee  There were some energy tax provisions in the Housepassed energy bill last August  Chris and I will consult tomorrow to see if this issue was included in that billnnAside from the tax issue Barton bill would require the type of interconnection rulemaking that FERC is now conducting both for connections to local distribution and to transmission  In each case the cost of interconnection would have to be comparable to what the utility charges others similarly situated  I will go back to double check but off the top of my head I recall that the Bingaman draft specifically socializes the costs of interconnectionnnJohnnnOriginal MessagenFrom Steffes James D nSent Wednesday October 31 2001 140 PMnTo

Nov 1 meeting will be focused more on establishing the procedure that FERC will follow to tackle the interconnection issues other than costs such as timelines basic procedures  ERCOT will present its agreement and procedures and EPSA will present a list of problems that members have had  Enron worked closely with other EPSA members over the past several years on problems that we have encountered in the interconnection procedures and IAs  EEI will also make a presentation  Additionally as you are probably aware over the past several years we have discussed problems with FERC hotline and have also had FERC staff call us to inquire about general interconnection issues  this ANOPR is meant to address many of those issuesnnAt the end of the Nov 1 meeting other meeting participants will have a brief amount of time to raise issues  Donna Fulton will attend for Enron  FERC then plans to convene a series of meetings to establish generic interconnection procedures and parts of an IA results due to FERC Dec 14  We will then also submit Enron comments on the ERCOT IA and procedures by Dec 21  nnFERC IS NOT addressing the cost issues during this stage of the proceedings therefore it will most likely not be dealing with the tax grossup and crediting issues yet  It plans to deal with cost issues in a subsequent rulemaking  We certainly understand that cost issues are typically the most problematic part of interconnection negotiations but this is the way FERC wants to proceed  FERC will continue to deal with cost issues in orders when disputed IAs are filed at FERC unexecutednnBy way of background on ERCOT as I understand it ERCOT basically rolls in the interconnection costs networktype upgrades to the entire grid through TCOS an uplift  However TCOS are not allowed to be unlimited  ERCOT has the ability to decide whether the generator interconnection is in the best interest of the grid  Some attribute all the new generation in ERCOT to this method  We will need to formulate Enrons view in the next phase of the interconnection proceedingnnFor Thurs meeting I think Donna should raise these issuesn While certain basic aspects of the IA should be standardized to eliminate the waste of time we usually face dealing with the same problems over and over the IA should be flexible enough to allow for individual business circumstances for example the notice to proceed that we have been includingnn While having timelines and procedures are fine the larger problem has been getting utilities to actually follow their own filed procedures for example Entergy was

MarknSubject RE FERC rulemaking on Generator InterconnectionnnnI skimmed the attached NOPR looking for the approach FERC was proposing to take to the key issue we fought over here in CA a couple of years ago  Although I did not see the word congestion the implication of what I read is that the generator would pay for his extension cord plus any congestion impacts that it makes on the grid  The implication of the last statement is that the generator would put the grid back into the condition it was in but for the new generator  That is great assuming I did not skim from too high an altitude  Did InnI also read the thing from the point of view of an issue that I had forgotten about until recently  That is if the generator pays for all of this upgrade and but for stuff and then gives it to the utility are there taxes due on the gift  When we developed our project in Pittsburg CA PGEs initial position was that we owed them for the upgrades AND for the taxes on the upgrades about 35  40 additional charge which they turned over to the state and fed  This is potentially A LOT of money to waste on an interconnect if it is an expensive one  Working with Enrons tax dept I do not remember specifically with whom we convinced PGE that taxes were probably not due for various reasons and we mutually agreed to get a private letter ruling from the IRS confirming  We also agreed that IF the taxes were ever due that we would pay them  I understand that that IRS ruling was put in abeyance pending some sort of law congress was considering  I may be making this up here as I go along because Calpine bought the project from us and I lost track of the various machinations  The point of all of this  Is it reasonable in this NOPR process on interconnection to address the tax issue  Is it too late  Is it irrelevant to the FERC process  Does anyone know the status of the law making process  nnI am concerned about taxes for two reasons  First many of the opponents to the proposed NOPR approach thought that all grid upgrades should be paid for by the utility and  included in rate base  In other words all generators are good and benefit the ratepayers  On fundamental grounds they will resist paying for upgrades  If they believe that they will get the insult after injury treatment pay for upgrades AND for taxes on the upgrades they will resist the NOPR more strenously  FYI to everyone Calpine strongly resisted paying for upgrades at Pittsburg and somehow got out of it  And guess what  Now with all of the new plants  1200MW added by Calpine within a 5 mile area of 2500 MW of existing  there are congestion problems around all of the projects just as we forecasted  ISO is now considering adding a new zone andor charging PGE andor the projects for congestion  Because PGE did not and probably never will in our lifetime add the grid upgrades so as to include in ratebase the projects will be hurt  Because all of this is not forecastable in the context of developing a project in a timely manner this outcome exactly as we had forecasted is why we supported the approach in the proposed NOPR  Second perhaps naively I am assuming that the tax issue is no different for gas pipeline upgrades than for electric transmission system upgrades  On a project we are now developing in Roseville CA we are faced with significant gas pipeline system upgrades in PGEs system  Significant grossups for tax impacts of the gift are are being discussed as I remember for Pittsburgs electric transmission system upgrades  Since it sounds like the same issue sure would be nice if we could get some appropriate precedence going  Any possibliity of dealing with the tax issues in this NOPRnnnnOriginal MessagenFrom Lindberg Susan nSent Friday October 26 2001 729 AMnTo Parquet David

bDavidnnYou asked me to provide my opinion about the employment agreement provisions relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance  nnThe bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements with a target bonus is as followsnntProvided that Enron meets its earnings targets and provided that Employee is rated within the top 25 of the performance criteria under Enrons annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question Employees annual bonus amounts under the Plan for calendar years 2001 2002 and 2003 payable in 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively shall be based on an annual bonus target of nnThis language does not address a persons performance as compared to ones peers but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 25 of those criteria  Thus if there are only 3 rating categories ie 1 2 3 distributed as 108010 then only the people in the top category would be within the top 2533 of the rating criteria  nnGiven the huge change in our process however there is an argument that the above language cannot be applied to the current scheme and that instead we should look at the top 25 of the peer group instead of performance criteria even though that was not the intent of the provision when it was draftednnAs a result I would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories ie 2A 2B or 2C  That way persons who fall out in categories 1 or 2A would be eligible for the target bonus  If there is a decision not to break  down the middle 80 further then it would be useful to look at those employees with a bonus target that we think is too high For those employees a more conservative approach may be to evaluate them on a scale that is more subdivided than the 108010 breakdown and to document that they fell out in the bottom 75 of the categories under that process  nnOf course it goes without saying that we should ensure consistent treatment based on race sex national origin age etc in this processnnPlease let me know if you have any questionsnnnn,1

Microsoft Salaried EmployeenAlleges Discrimination Based on Race Sex nnnnSEATTLEA suit has been filed against Microsoft Corp alleging the company nmaintains a systemic and pervasive practice of discriminating against African nAmerican and female salaried employees affecting pay rates and promotion nopportunities Donaldson v Microsoft Corp WD Wash No C001684P n10400 nSuch discrimination at the company is the standard operating procedure the nlawsuit said nnThe suit filed Oct 4 in federal court in Seattle seeks back pay other job nbenefits and compensatory and punitive damages for a proposed class of about n400 African American employees and some 4500 female employees nnMark Murray company spokesman said Microsoft does not tolerate ndiscrimination of any kind nnWe take these kinds of issues very seriously Murray said regarding the nlawsuit The company has an active diversity policy and seeks to recruit nand promote minorities and women Murray told BNA Oct 12 He said he could nnot comment on any specific aspects of the lawsuit nnThe class would include all current and former female salaried employees who nworked for Microsoft beginning Feb 23 1999 and all current and former nAfrican American salaried employees who worked at the company beginning Oct n4 1998 Microsoft employs some 18000 workers in the US the complaint nsaid About 25 percent to 3 percent are African American and about 26 npercent are women nnMurray said the company has about 27250 employees in the US including n21767 in Western Washington In the US 263 percent of Microsoft nemployees are women and 222 percent minorities he said nnThe lawsuit was filed by Cohen Milstein Hausfeld  Toll of Seattle The nnamed plaintiff Monique Donaldson sued on behalf of herself and a class of nall similarly situated African American and similarly situated female nsalaried employees at Microsoft nnAfrican American and female salaried employees of Microsoft are routinely nsubjected to a pattern and practice of race and sex discrimination affecting nthe terms and conditions of their employment at the company the complaint nsaid The violationsof Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 the Civil nRights Act of 1991 and Civil Rights Act of 1871are systemic in nature nand constitute a pattern and practice of conduct which permeates Microsofts noperations the lawsuit maintains nnnExcessive Subjectivity AllegednnThe complaint said the company allows excessive subjectivity in decisions ninvolving promotions and compensation Microsoft has retaliated against nemployees in the class who complained either internally or externally about nMicrosofts treatment of African American and female employees by giving nunjustified lowered performance evaluations and constructively terminating nthemn nThe lawsuit said the company uses an excessively subjective evaluation nsystem that allows managers who are predominantly white males to rate nemployees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit nPerformance evaluations for instance use a fivepoint scal but scores of nfive the highest number are not awarded Within any organization of the ncompany only a certain number of employees are allowed to receive each nscore which can range from 25 to 45 the lawsuit said nnThus no matter how good or bad the actual performance of employees a ncertain number of them must still receive the lower scores Any employee nwith a 25 score is placed on a personal improvement plan or asked to nresign the complaint said nnStack rankings are used to rank employees in the same job category and norganizational unit from best to worst the complaint said Employees can be nranked higher under the stack ranking than others who receive numerically nhigher performance evaluations the lawsuit said nnObtaining higher stack rankings is often governed by an employees personal npopularity with other managers because the rankings mix employees working nfor different managers nnIn addition to allowing discrimination in performance appraisals the company nalso has a pattern of paying African American and female employees salaries nsubstantially lower than those paid white males doing similar work with nthe same or lesser skills and with similar or lesser experience the lawsuit nsaid nnFurthermore excessively subjective decisionmaking criteria are applied in npromotions which favor white males with fewer qualifications than African nAmericans and female employees nnnnBy Nan NethertonnnnnCopyright  2000 by The Bureau of National Affairs Inc Washington DCnnnnnnn,1

North County Times Escondido Califnn October 17 2000 nnnnOct 13PORTLAND OreA private investigation of state power markets has ncome to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating ncapacity this summernnThe state enjoyed a 32 percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared nand the states power manager declared 36 separate power emergencies nbecause California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage naccording to the investigationnnThe author of the investigations preliminary report Portlandbased neconomist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough said at a nconference of analysts power traders and electricity industry regulators nThursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies nmanipulated the production of power from June through August to create a nfalse shortage and push up pricesnnThe Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example it ran at well nbelow its full capacity for much of June even though wholesale power prices n and consumer electricity bills  shot to well above the generating nplants cost of productionnnThe actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an nanalysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency which monitors nemissionsnnWe are seeing a lot of undergeneration McCullough said This is market npower in actionnnMarket power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market nparticipants  in this case suppliers  to influence pricesnnMany of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed ntheir belief that supply shortages were very real this summer and ncontributed to high prices but several participants said deregulation has nreduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts nMainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal nagencies including the EPAnnConventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego nCounty are scantnnEncinas operators a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc and NRG nEnergy Inc called Cabrillo Power confirmed that the power plant had no nabnormal maintenance problems The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said nWednesday that the power plant was well within its statemandated pollution nlimitsnnBut David Lloyd the corporate secretary of Cabrillo denied that the Encina nplant has been used to game the San Diego County power marketsnnThat cant possibly be right Lloyd said of McCulloughs analysis In nNorth County we were right on the ragged edge of being off an emergency nshutdown because of heavy outputnnWithout knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off nI cant comment Lloyd saidnnWe certainly dont want to be accused of anything wrongful he said We ndont have that much power in California and for us to be shutting down in nCalifornia to push up the price somewhere else doesnt make sense for us We nwant to run all we can when the prices are highnnElectricity prices have soared to record levels since May resulting in a ndoubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the 12 million ncustomers of San Diego Gas  Electric Co and causing an estimated 5 billion nin losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas  ElectricnnState lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with na retail rate cap but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow nbeyond 300 million if high wholesale prices persistnnNo fewer than five private state and federal investigations are under way to nassess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western nstates The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies nwhich produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit nderegulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright nmanipulation in order to increase profitsnnInquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission Electricity nOversight Board and attorney general along with a Federal Energy Regulatory nCommission investigation were launched in July and August Staff ninvestigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they nare still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market datannMcCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium nof large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate nthe price spikes His effort is thought to be the first to complete an nexhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount nof electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that nwas actually usednnChief among McCulloughs findings was that demand for power was lower this nsummer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council na federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web nof power transmission lines that connect California to 13 other Western nstates British Columbia and northern MexiconnMcCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North nCounty Times and the initial reaction of the states energy community was none of deep skepticismnnEPA data is notoriously unreliable said Frank Wolak a Stanford professor nand the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California nIndependent System Operator the agency that manages the state grid and which nhas paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer To gauge the actual noutput of power plants that burn fossil fuel McCullough used emissions data nfrom the EPAnnGreed would get the best of anybody Wolak said I found a lot of hours nwhere instate generators were exceeding nameplate capacity These guys were ncranking it outnnWolak in a study of power markets for the system operator did conclude nhowever that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was nthe major cause of higher prices this summernnAt the conference in Portland most of the panelists did not openly criticize nMcCulloughs analysis but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing nhigher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real nshortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western statesnnLow hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures nin the Southwest were blamed for limiting Californias ability to import nelectricitynnOthers said state and federal regulators along with market participants nthemselves wont really know what happened until more experts look at hard nmarket information that is in short supplynnRon Eachus the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission said nmarket information is routinely withheld from regulators

bWhile I appreciate the virtue of flying below the radar if possible the nmatter here is complicated by the fact that FERCs discovery rules 18 CFR nSubpart D pertain only to proceedings set for hearing    and to such nproceedings as the Commission may order  18 CFR 385401  In this case nFERC stated that a trialtype hearing is not necessary     and nspecifically rejected the use of a trialtype evidentiary hearing  Slip nop at 4748  n97  Thus while I have not researched the matter as yet my npreliminary view is that the CPUCs attempt to invoke FERCs discovery nprocesses would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERCs Nov 1 order nand its regulations unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case  nThe CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it nspecifically attempts to equate paper hearings with trialtype hearings nsee page 1 of its MotionnnThe CPUCs motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery nin this case under Rule 401  While the CPUCs motion does not apply directly nto marketers FERCs ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or nsomeone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties  As a result we nneed to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to npresent our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing nwith an expedited decisional track particularly in light of the fact that nStaff has already conductednn Jeffrey Watkiss 110800 1031AM nDoes anyone have an idea as to why marketers including EPMI are not nincluded in

hearing and I am going to find out from Atul about whether Indian nlaw governs these policies since Indian law requires us to have an Indian nfronting policy  nnOn another issue that came up on the call this morning Ken I was asking nJustin about governing law specifically because I wanted to know if there was nany law India or English requiring insurers to disclose information nregarding risk to the insured so we could cite some law perhaps to compel nBeachcrofts to hand over the Liburdi report   For example the Texas ninsurance code has evolved from a vague duty of good faith  fair dealing nstandard in some instances to specific laws preventing insurers from doing ncertain things detrimental to the insured  Justin tells me English law in nthis regard consists only of precedential case law but it still could be nhelpful  Because of the commercial risk outside the ambit of arbitration in nthe instance it might be worthwhile to consider going into the London nCommercial Court to seek some sort of extraordinary relief to prevent United nIndia from withholding this information which is critical to running these nmachines   If in fact  there truly is a 50 chance of failure in these nmachines yet they wont share that evidence with us this is a commercial nrisk DPC cant afford regardless of coverage and apart from the narbitration  Im wearing my commercial hat instead of my legal hat today  nAlthough Justin expressed concern about jurisdiction United India did us the nfavor of bringing  suit in London Commercial Court earlier and thus having navailed itself to the courts and having Peter Hirsts emphatic witness nstatement that makes a compelling case for the court to take jurisdiction I nthink it is worth considering  if they continue to

Cost of PollutionnReduction by Dallas Burtraw Karen Palmer Ranjit Bharvirkar and AnthonynPaul Resources for the FuturennBefore I discuss the specific papers and presenters one big picture pointnneeds to be made  There was an unchallenged consensus at this conferencenthat the generators have exercised market power to the tune of billions ofndollars  The focus was on how and how much not whether  The good news isnthat I heard no evidence supporting any collusion theory the thought wasnthat generators are making independent output and pricing decisions knowingnthey could influence the market price given the auction rules and thencompletely inelastic demand  On the other hand I would have to say thatnthe economic work on the tacit collusion hypothesis in incomplete at bestnThe bad news is that the scale of potential overcharges is pretty staggeringn 5 billion  The plaintiffs will be able to put together quite a damagenstudynnCrespo Bidding Asymmetries in UK  This is a marginally relevant papernexamining whether bidders in the UK electricity auction markets behaved in anleaderfollower mode ie asymmetrically  Crespos model shows that in anuniform pricesetting auction with clearing price rules a price setter willnemerge and take all prices above marginal cost  Thus above marginal costnpricing does not require coordination  Crespo from NERA appearednknowledgeable but is not an inspiring speaker  His paper also got roughednup a bit in the audience questioning segmentnnPuller Pricing and Firm Conduct in Californias Deregulated ElectricitynMarket  This is a very relevant paper as it tries to determine whethernmarket power presumably exercised in California was static or dynamicnmeaning the product of individual firm decisionmaking static or tacitncollusion dynamic  The period studied was 498 to 1299  Puller foundnevidence of static market power consistent with socalled Cournot pricingnThis theory posits that in an oligopoly firms will take their rivalsnobserved priceoutput decisions as a given and decide how to maximizenprofitability given that behavior  He then tried to determine whether anyndynamic games were occurring meaning a game where firms recognize theirninterdependence and try to follow a supergame trigger strategy in whichnfirms try to induce favorable responses from rivals  Its quite complicatednhow he goes about this but fundamentally he tries to correlate observednoutput decisions with how a firm at that time might have expected a changenin its behavior to affect its future share of the market  With thisnmethodology Puller finds what he called weak evidence of forwardlookingndynamic pricing for a brief time in 1998 but not otherwise  My impressionnwas that the evidence for 1998 was very weak and the logic used to arrivenat this conclusion was also weaknnPuller then went at this a second time with a theory that attempts tondetermine what a firms supply function would look like if it wasnexercising static and dynamic market power and then comparing this to annestimate of that firms actual supply function  I found this even morenspeculative than the first theory  Nonetheless the results are basicallynthe same  evidence of static but not dynamic market powernnPuller took a lot of heat for the methodology of this paper during thenquestioning segment  Hes not a dynamic speaker and does not appear to mento be a strong expert candidatennAnjali Sheffrins commentary was very important  She is the Director ofnMarket Analysis for CAISO  After general comments on Crespo and Puller shenlaunched in to a discussion of whether their models explained the Californianexperience  This turned out to be a preview of the CAISO FERC filing ofnlast week in which they allege 55 billion in market powerrelatednovercharges from May 200 to Feb 2001  That filing and Sheffrins reportnfollow  They are essential readingnn  2001032214541122276pdfpdf  2001032214585222924pdfpdfnnSheffrin maintains that it was the absence of imports during this periodnthat left the market power of the California generators unchecked  Thisnpermitted the instate generators to engage in either economic or

2000 defined and categorized bidding patternsnand identified economic or physical withholding and then calculatednbidcost markup and a monopoly rent  She found what she claimed was strongnevidence of both types of withholding but that economic withholding is thendominant bidding pattern used by the five large California generatorsnWhile Sheffrins study does not name names it claims that most of the fiveninstate suppliers and many of the 16 large importers displayed biddingnpatterns which were consistent with the exercise of market powernnBernstein and Himmelstein were positively gleeful during this presentationnnOn the question of collusion Sheffrins study is not terribly illuminatingnShe maintains that the dominant bidding pattern is consistent with twoncharacteristics of a supply function equilibrium model of oligopolistnpricing  I take that to mean Cournot which is a static noncollusivenmodel  However when you read her study youll see the picture is notnentirely clearnnLien The Curse of Market Power  This is only marginally relevant for usnas its thesis is that forwardlooking supply contracts are better for bothnproducers and society  Everyone seemed to agree  and were

be funny  I couldnt tellnwhether he believed his study proved that I dont think it even speaks tonit  But Bernstein and Himmelstein applauded him when he finished grinningnear to earnnSeverin Borenstein UC Berkeley and the conference director was supposed toncomment on JK but hardly did  He said that the generators would have beennstupid not to exercise market power given the supplydemand

counterclaim if we get sued if we do not perform on nswaps or physical contractsn nInitial Clifford Chance view  None  no suitable  preemptive action navailable to Enron  defences  counterclaims only

njudgement approx 2  3 months to get court in England  If so to defeat nsummary proceedings thus delaying matters to full trial ECTRIC would then nneed to establish prima facie case for either defence on breach of  implied nterm v difficult indeed but gut reaction is that London Commercial Court ncould be swayed by an argument that actual counterparty has acted in bad nfaith eg manipulated mkt

deregulations failure to deliver a competitive nmarket electricity wholesalers have quietly developed a vast and rapidly ngrowing business of buying and selling power among themselvesnnThe deals take place on hightech trading floors in Houston and elsewhere naround the country as well as on Internetbased trading systemsnnSome experts say this electricity trading is a key mechanism for raising nconsumer power prices yet its largely unregulatednnElectricity trading is like buying stock  when you have ability to change nthe stock price said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economics professor nand member of the state grid operators market surveillance groupnnEnergy companies say the buying and selling of contracts to deliver power nprovides risk management allowing plant owners to presell their electricity nlock in prices and avoid fluctuations The rough and tumble of the free nmarket they add is the most efficient means of allocating a resource like nelectricitynnBut industry critics say trading is far from a competitive market paradigm nIn their view its a means of communication  a way for energy insiders to ncollude and raise prices under the guise of competitionnnTo be sure the trading arms of major energy companies have emerged as stars nin an industry where profit surges of 300 percent or 400 percent are not nuncommonnnThe transactions shrouded in secrecy can leave ownership of a critical ncommodity in unknown hands Consider the case of power generated by AES nCorps California plantsnnIn 1998 AES made a bold move Immediately after purchasing power plants that ngave it control of 10 percent of the states electric generating capacity nthe company sold the output from its plants for the next 20 years to Williams nCosnnWilliams did not sit on this treasure trove of electrons The Tulsa Okla ncompany soon sold 80 percent of what it boughtnnIt is difficult to say who owns that power now Some might be owned by Sempra nTrading a sister company of SDGE Or some could be owned by Enron Corp nthe nations biggest electricity tradernnA spokeswoman for Williams conceded that Williams itself may have repurchased nsome of the electricity it sold earlier But trading companies closely guard ntheir positionsnnThis much can be said with certainty Electricity that AES sold for less than n5 cents per kilowatthour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the nwholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for nconsumers that was 300 percent highernnWilliams trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter this nyearnnnAdvance salesnAll this buying and selling creates curious confluencesnIn their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices generating companies nsuch as Duke Energy  operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and nothers in the state  frequently note that they sell most of their nelectricity far in advance But they acknowledge less often that their ntrading units may also be buying power which could boost the companys nelectricity inventorynnDuke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its ntrading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits nwhich soared 324 percent in the first quarter to 348 millionnnIt is a companys power traders who frequently direct plant operators to nincrease or decrease the generation of power in

regulationnBut despite the obvious temptation to manipulate the market the burgeoning nelectricity trading business has remained largely unregulatednThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does require quarterly filings from nenergy traders but these often provide incomplete information or at least nlittle that has been of concern to FERCnnIn fact although the trading of electricity grew more than a hundredfold nfrom 1996 to 2000 FERC has taken no major enforcement action against a ntrader After the onset of the California crisis last year FERC has acted nonce That was against Williams which agreed to pay 8 million without nadmitting guilt to resolve an allegation that it withheld supply to pump up npricesnnFERCs record of enforcement in the area of power trading stands in

complicated marketnnThe sophisticated marketers and traders have simply moved past us Were nkind of horse and buggy in our approach and theyre out there in rocket ships nflying around  The problem is that sophisticated traders dont necessarily nproduce reasonable prices They produce profitsnnBefore deregulation electricity trading was a lowkey affair Regulated nutilities dealt power back and forth on a reciprocal basis to fill nelectricity shortfalls in their control areas There was little trading for nprofit until the mid1990s after federal legislation and FERC rulings opened nthe marketnnMajor traders include large energy companies sister companies of nCalifornias major utilities and Wall Street firmsnnnMarket volatilitynIn many ways the trading of power is similar to that of other commodities nBut there are important differences Because it cannot be stored and its use nis so fundamental the price of electricity is the most volatile of allnWhen supplies are tight a single

bThe prehearing conference in the CA case was an interesting proceeding  It became very apparent that the ISO was primarily responsible for the delay in producing data  The parties complained that they had not received what the ISO had promised  The PX complained that they had received NO reliable data from ISO it was riddled with errors and that they were at the same point as at the beginning of the entire proceeding  The PX needs the ISO data in order to commence generating the data that the PX itself needs to produce  In any event the new delayed schedule is a positive development  It is noteworthy that we were able to group consideration of refunds issues and offsets to refunds on the same date October 26 previously refund testimony was considered first and testimony related to possible offsets to refunds was considered on a subsequent date  This is very positive since it reduces the chance that the proceeding will be only about refunds and that the offsets issue will be marginalized  Ray Alvareznn Original MessagenFrom tComnes Alan  nSenttWednesday September 05 2001 742 PMnTotComnes Alan Gary Fergus Email Alvarez Ray Frank Robert Belden Tim Sanders Richard B Curry Wanda Nicolay Christi LnCctSteffes James DnSubjecttRE Refund Cases TimelinesConfidential Atty Client Work ProductnnThe DC Team Linda Robertson Ray Alvarez attended and reported on todays prehearing conference in the California case  The schedule has moved back about a full month mostly due to the time required by PX and CAISO to produce mitigated market clearing prices and to rerun settlements based on those revised prices  Testimony by Enron on what it is owed is now not due until October 26  In addition to adopting this schedule the ALJ reported that the FERC likely not rule on petitions for rehearing of the July 25 order until October 15 2001nnA revised schedule is attached  To see how it has changed you can toggle Track Changes  Hightlight on Screen on and offnnThe PNW case is moving along on schedule changes attached are corrections rather than actual changes to the schedule  Notably in todays case Seattle and Tacoma waived all cross on TFG witnesses including EnronsnnAlan Comnesnn  File Refund Cases Calendar 090501doc  n Original MessagenFrom tComnes Alan  nSenttThursday August 30 2001 132 PMnTotGary Fergus Email Alvarez Ray Frank Robert Belden TimnCctSteffes James DnSubjecttRefund Cases TimelinesConfidential Atty Client Work ProductnnTimnnPer your requestnnEverybody else  please forward correctionsupdates to mennThanksnnAlan Comnesnn  File Refund Case Calendarsdoc ,1

CoviellonSubject RE Draft of Market rate filingnnn          Marcus Here are the others points I wanted to make just brieflynn                1  I still think I need to talk to FERC staff before we filen     Heres why  n                      FERC as you know is about to issue a new rule n                       on marketbased rate eligibilityn                      In the meantime theyve been kicking out a very n                      high percentage of MBR applicants for trumped upn                    reasons  Ie issuing deficiency letters on issues we n                    know they dont care about  I think the real reason n                    is they dont want to issue a lot of approvals until the n                    new rule comes outn                         No matter how perfect our filing is were liablen                     to get kicked out too  They might not want to given                     MBR to a new Enron entity until they see the newn                     rulen                          The best way to deal with that is to sit down with n                     staff go over the draft page by page and seen                     what more they want  But that would take too longn                     because of staffs schedulen                         The second best way is for me to call Dan n                    Larcamp or Mike Coleman at FERC tell them that n                    were not in a huge hurry but we really dont want an                    deficiency letter read him the language in the draftn                    about how well comply with the new rule and see if n                    thats good enough  If he suggests different n                    language well have to put it in theren                       Alternatively if we really want to try to slide this n                    through without saying anything to FERC in n                    advance we can file it and just hope that the n                    language we have about complying with the new n                    rule  is good enough   But thats really not what I n                    would recommend nn         If we do decide to call FERC I could call right away and probably get an answer in time to file today  If not then certainly tomorrow Otherwise were pretty much ready nn             2  I really do think that we could ask for 30 days without raising any eyebrows nn

Dave you old communist your forgetting the trading function isnwhat mitigates the risk The traders are the in between people who guessnat the price  Sometimes they guess right and sometimes they

Things in the Peoplex0fs Republic of Californian  The ISO Replies to the EOB ReportnnSeveral of you people commented to me that the ISOx0fs reply to thenPUCEOB report was very good  I decided to excerpt the best sections ofnit for the Burrito  The full document can be found on the ISOx0fsnwebsitennx0f the PUCEOB Report asserts that the suspected activities ofncertain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading tonthe Bay Area blackouts the following day In fact the events of June 13nand June 14 were completely independent of one another The voltageninstability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alonen exceptionally high loads insufficient generation in the specificnlocal area and transmission constraints that prevented the import ofngeneration from outside the areannx0fThe Report states that the ISO x0fnever triedx0f to call upon consumers tonreduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts In fact the ISOnhad in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed tonreduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program undernwhich customers have agreed through a prior solicitation to curtailnenergy use in exchange for a feennx0fThe Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid bynx0fpurchasersx0f of energy as a result of the recent price spikes eg 12nbillion in the month of June alone These assertions leave one with thenmistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid bynthe UDCs andor passed through to customers However in determining thentotal cost of energy one must determine the impact of any forwardncontracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energynmarkets These contracts which are designed to x0flockinx0f a specificnprice in advance of realtime or near realtime market activities arenspecifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility andnare standard in all commodities markets We have reason to believe thatnsome of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of thenrecent price spikesnnx0fIn a similar vein the reports asserts that California x0fmight wellx0fnhave saved 110 million dollars had a 250 price cap been in place innMay and June This assertion assumes that all energy purchases wouldnhave been made at or below the 250 bid cap In fact during times ofnpeak demand when all of the statex0fs generation has been exhausted thenISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation In ordernto secure the necessary power the ISO must purchase on a bilateralnbasis this energy from resources located outside of the ISOx0fs controlnareannx0fThe Report asserts that California power markets x0fare not nowncompetitivex0f and implies erroneously in our view that this is thennormal state of affairs It is not The Market Surveillance Committeenhas noted that x0fmarket power in the California energy market appears tonarisenprimarily during periods of peak demandx0f and warned that demand growthnwould increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000nnx0fThe Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a selfinterestednboard and not to the citizens of California This simply is not thencase The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act andnto the rules and regulations of FERC which dictate in part thatnwholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the publicninterest The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed andnapproved by FERC Every change to our market design and virtually everynaspect of the ISOx0fs business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERCnThe FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by thenstate agencies and such agencies have in fact been active participantsnin the FERC proceedingsnnx0fThe Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affectednby restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have madenCalifornia more vulnerable to supply shortages This assertion isnunfounded Significant load growth in California and neighboring statesncoupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in bothngeneration and transmission have caused this vulnerabilitynRestructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many foldnOnly by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval andnsiting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements willnthis significant shortage be addressedx0fnn Things in the Peoplex0fs Republic of Californian  Reflections on a Day of Senate

thinknnVincenn  Original Messagen From     Frank A Wolak wolakziaStanfordEDUENRONn Sent Friday October 19 2001 428 PMn To   Kaminski Vince Jn Subjectnn Vincenn   Ive been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorsen the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJMn I just wanted to warn you that Im not suren this is in Enrons longterm interest at all  Let me explainn why  Feel free to give me a call if youd like to talkn more about thisnn   First let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricingn and specifically pricing congestion  However the way that PJMn implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatilityn and reduce the transparency of the market  Specifically then PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus an 10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deemsn is out of merit in one of the three zones in region  The factn that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause forn alarmn Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and reruns its pricesettingn software to compute new nodal prices  The way I have somewhatn unfairly decribed this pricesetting process is that then PJM ISO decides what prices it would liken for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them  This is notn a transparent market nor one where it makes any sense to buyn the risk management services that Enron provides  Then only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market isn that kind that comes about if they need imports into their controln arean to meet demand  Under these circumstances you need to pay then imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your marketnn   However bear in mind FERCs desire to make a large RTO on then East Coast  This will effectively mean little importsn to the East Coast RTO so all bids can be mitigated atn the discretion of the ISO  Paying marketclearing prices ton costofservicen mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatilityn It effectively kills off the development of risk management atn the wholesale and retail level  Power marketing becomes much lessn profitable because retailers know you can always buy at costmitigatedn pricesnn   In short the PJM model is not market  It is just an alternativen form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reducesn price volatility but it is not good for consumers or traders becausen they justn get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional costofservicen regulation You pay marketclearing prices to costofservicen mitigated bids but under regulation you could just payn costofservicen prices and eliminate the inframarginal profits to low costn generatorsnn   As we discussed during our dinner I think the two biggest sourcesn of benefits from restructuring will come from getting the demandsiden involved in the market and from more efficient risk management  An necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflectn actual conditions in the market including the extent of market powern exercised  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for marketn participants to make the investment necessary to management  The PJMn model is just way to have a market in name without achieving anyn significant benefits to consumers or energy tradersnn FranknnnnThis email is the property of Enron Corp andor its relevant affiliate

bWolak makes some good points  In ERCOT Enron is in support of nodal pricing  I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJMs implementation however but for a market with nodal prices and unilateral bids  aka unbalanced schedules congestion reflect by price differentials etc  I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids  This is something we dont want and something for which I am not aware we have advocated  Perhaps in Enrons promotion of locational prices it has been retold as PJMstyle locational prices  Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumorsnnMartinnn Original MessagenFrom tKaminski Vince J  nSenttFriday October 19 2001 435 PMnTotLin MartinnCctvkaminskiaolcomnSubjecttFW  nnMartin LancennWhat do you thinknnVincenn Original MessagenFrom tFrank A Wolak wolakziaStanfordEDUENRON  nSenttFriday October 19 2001 428 PMnTotKaminski Vince JnSubjectt nnVincenn  Ive been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorsenthe nodal pricing model as implemented in PJMnI just wanted to warn you that Im not surenthis is in Enrons longterm interest at all  Let me explainnwhy  Feel free to give me a call if youd like to talknmore about thisnn  First let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricingnand specifically pricing congestion  However the way that PJMnimplements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatilitynand reduce the transparency of the market  Specifically thenPJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus an10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deemsnis out of merit in one of the three zones in region  The factnthat a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarmnThen the ISO takes this mitigated bid and reruns its pricesettingnsoftware to compute new nodal prices  The way I have somewhatnunfairly decribed this pricesetting process is that thenPJM ISO decides what prices it would likenfor a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them  This is notna transparent market nor one where it makes any sense to buynthe risk management services that Enron provides  Thenonly price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market isnthat kind that comes about if they need imports into their control areanto meet demand  Under these circumstances you need to pay thenimports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your marketnn  However bear in mind FERCs desire to make a large RTO on thenEast Coast  This will effectively mean little importsnto the East Coast RTO so all bids can be mitigated atnthe discretion of the ISO  Paying marketclearing prices to costofservicenmitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatilitynIt effectively kills off the development of risk management atnthe wholesale and retail level  Power marketing becomes much lessnprofitable because retailers know you can always buy at costmitigatednpricesnn  In short the PJM model is not market  It is just an alternativenform of regulation that is politically attractive because it reducesnprice volatility but it is not good for consumers or traders because they justnget a higher cost form of regulation than traditional costofservicenregulation You pay marketclearing prices to costofservicenmitigated bids but under regulation you could just pay costofservicenprices and eliminate the inframarginal profits to low cost generatorsnn  As we discussed during our dinner I think the two biggest sourcesnof benefits from restructuring will come from getting the demandsideninvolved in the market and from more efficient risk management  Annecessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflectnactual conditions in the market including the extent of market powernexercised  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for marketnparticipants to make the investment necessary to management  The PJMnmodel is just way to have a market in name without achieving anynsignificant benefits to consumers or energy tradersnnFrank,1

Futures Continue Lower nnNatural gas futures on the NYMEX dropped lower yesterday as traders remained in a bearish mood following Wednesdays triple digit AGA report The July contract lost 0074 to 4038 per MMBtu trading most of the session above the 400 support level as warm weather in the Northeast kept demand firm August dipped 0088 to 4123 per MMBtu Local and shortterm traders early efforts to push prices lower were successful but some see the riskreward of additional selling at these levels limited On Wednesday the AGA reported a storage inventory build of 105 Bcf from the previous week well above both the 2000 injection of 78 Bcf and the 5year average of 81 Bcf for the comparable weeks The selling sparked by the AGA number was encouraged by some disappointment with weather conditions in the Northeast Earlier this week some forecasters were calling for warmer temperatures with some cities expected to be near 90 degrees But temperatures in the region have been in the low to mid80s However warmer weather is expected to continue in the East though this weekend Mild weather will linger in the northcentral and northwestern states California and the western states will

RegulationnnCalifornia lawmakers expect the FERC to strengthen its existing plan to limit power prices during emergencies by expanding the plan to the entire West for all hours of the day The plan would fall short of the price caps But expanding the existing formula for price limits has picked up support among Republicans who are under increasing pressure FERC Chairman Hebert has called a special commission hearing for Monday to address the continuing issues affecting California and the West The proposal seeks to have FERC set target prices for wholesale electricity prices on an aroundtheclock basis for the entire West Under the existing plan the FERC price limits are triggered when the state declares a power emergency and are based on the amount that generators can charge to produce power at the least efficient plant Hebert says that since the FERC relief plan went into effect on May 29th power prices in California have dropped to under 100 per MWh from earlier in May over the 300 per MWh The dayahead market in California recently traded about 45 per MWh nnENERGYnENERGY FEAs Complete Suite of Energy ProductsnBUILT FOR THE FUTUREnManage all your energy risksnBuild

the House Appropriations Committee have rejected a push by Democrats to cap West Coast power prices but Democrats said they will keep pressing the issue The panel voted along party lines to defeat a bill to force FERC to cap wholesale electricity prices in the West Democrats tried to stick the measure in a 65 billion spending bill that was intended mainly to fill out immediate defense needs this fiscal year Rejecting the price caps amendment Republicans argued it would not solve Californias problems of tight supplies but would further distort the marketplace House Republican Whip DeLay of Texas said Californias power crisis is the result of allowing environmental extremists to run the state government Saying the federal government should not intervene in Californias electricity market Rep Callahan of Alabama who chairs the House Appropriations Energy and Water subcommittee said I respectfully submit to you that youve made your own bed Democrats countered that limiting prices to cover production costs and a reasonable profit was essential to halt price gouging by unscrupulous suppliers Democrats hoped to persuade a few West Coast Republicans to support the price caps but those on the committee resisted Under the existing plan the FERC price limits are triggered when the state declares a power emergency and are based on the amount that generators can charge to produce

traders hesitant to take on new positions ahead of the weekend Trade and commercial activity was almost nonexistent and much of the activity was confined to low risk spread trading Bearish sentiment was offset by short covering ahead of the weekend although most traders say the downtrend is still intact in the absence of any significant weather change or hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico The July

shortcovering The market remains under pressure from mild weather and a series of largerthannormal storage injections that have filled storage to 49 of capacity Texas should return to very warm conditions this week In addition the Northeast and Midwest are expected to see a rise in temperatures early this week that will create stronger demand At test of support at the May 30th low of 367 is

further delays are possible if a number of factors do not fall into place by midJuly Including a failure of the California PUC to suspend its retail choice program or to extend a 003 rate increase on

Senate committee investigating alleged price manipulation Allegations against Duke Energy as the plants operator included throwing out spare parts to prolong the time a unit was out of service and ramping electricity output up and down to manipulate power prices Duke denied the latest allegations by former workers at its South Bay power plant saying it finds the charges disturbing and incredible Duke says the time has come for it to take a stand against this daily barrage of misinformation California has for months been accusing the Duke and other generators who purchased many of the states power plants of taking advantage of a chronic shortage of electricity and price gouging The governor is demanding 9 billion in refunds and numerous lawsuits have been filed The rhetoric has escalated into branding  the generators as pirates and even murderers and rapists of the California economy most of which is a smokescreen to hide their true agenda the forced donation of power to the state  When Duke took over the Southern California plant they kept on all of its employees for 2 years under an operating agreement Once that agreement expired Duke hired about 80 of the staff The 3 that testified were among those not offered jobs nnCommodity Futures Trading CommissionnNYMEX Natural Gas Futures nReportable Positions as of 61901 nOpen Interest 457143

bPer our discussion this morning below is a summary of items to discuss with GlynnnnAdding Enrons negative CTC claim to the list of claims PGEs filing included a list of top twenty creditors  Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list  The list is nonbinding however  PGE will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20  Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F for unsecured claims  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear preferably as uncontested in the April 20 filing Note if PGE does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claimnIncluding Enron on the Creditors Committee  PGE may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors committees  There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included 1 we are a big creditor 2 we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution and 3 we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO who were listed as significant creditors but are really just passthroughs for the suppliers  and PGE likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway,1

Departure of Chief Executiven ollowing is the text of an unsigned letter written in August to KennethnLn Lay the chairman of the Enron Corporation newsquotennredirectmarketwatchredirectctxMWhttpcustommarketwatchcomcuston mnytcomhtmlcompanyprofileaspsymbENRNQ after Jeffrey K Skillingn resigned unexpectedly as chief executive on Aug 14 Its author was latern identified as Sherron S Watkins a vice president for corporaten development at Enron The House Energy and Commerce Committee releasedn excerpts of the letter on Monday and the full letter yesterdaynnn Has Enron become a risky place to work For those of us who didnt getn rich over the last few years can we afford to stayn Skillings abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accountingn improprieties and valuation issues Enron has been very aggressive in itsn accounting  most notably the Raptor transactions and the Condor vehiclen We do have valuation issues with our international assets and possiblyn some of our EES MTM positionsn The spotlight will be on us the market just cant accept that Skillingnisn leaving his dream job I think that the valuation issues can be fixed andn reported with other good will writedowns to occur in 2002 How do we fixn the Raptor and Condor deals They unwind in 2002 and 2003 we will haventon pony up Enron stock and that wont go unnoticedn To the layman on the street it will look like we recognized funds flownofn 800 million from merchant asset sales in 1999 by selling to a vehiclen Condor that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock in laternyearsn Is that really funds flow or is it cash from equity issuancen We have recognized over 550 million of fair value gains on stocks vianourn swaps with Raptor Much of that stock has declined significantly  Avicin by 98 percent from 178 million to 5 million the New Power Company byn 80 percent from 40 a share to 6 a share The value in the swaps wontn be there for Raptor so once again Enron will issue stock to offset thesen losses Raptor is an LJM entity It sure looks to the layman on thenstreetn that we are hiding losses in a related company and will compensate thatn company with Enron stock in the futuren I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accountingn scandals My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing onnmyn rsum the business world will consider the past successes as nothingnbutn an elaborate accounting hoax Skilling is resigning now for personaln reasons but I would think he wasnt having fun looked down the road andn knew this stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon ship now thann resign in shame in two yearsn Is there a way our accounting gurus can unwind these deals now I haven thought and thought about a way to do this but I keep bumping into onen big problem  we booked the Condor and Raptor deals in 1999 and 2000 wen enjoyed wonderfully high stock price many executives sold stock we thenn try and reverse or fix the deals in 2001 and its a bit like robbing then bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years later Nice try butn investors were hurt they bought at 70 and 80 a share looking for 120nan share and now theyre at 38 or worse We are under too much scrutiny andn there are probably one or two disgruntled redeployed employees who known enough about the funny accounting to get us in troublen What do we do I know this question cannot be addressed in then allemployee meeting but can you give some assurances that you andnCauseyn will sit down and take a good hard objective look at what is going ton happen to Condor and Raptor in 2002 and 2003n Summary of Alleged Issuesnn RAPTOR Entity was capitalized with LJM equity That equity is at riskn however the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paid to LJMn If the Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected there is non commitment to contribute more equityn The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is some form ofn Enron NP restricted stock and stock rightsn Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with the Raptorn entities locking in our values for various equity investments we holdn As disclosed in 2000 we recognized 500 million of revenue from then equity derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlyingn securitiesn This year with the value of our stock declining the underlyingn capitalization of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushingn for reserves against our MTM positionsn To avoid such a writedown or reserve in quarter one 2001 we enhancedn the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles committing more ENE sharesn My understanding of the thirdquarter problem is that we must enhancen the vehicles by 250 millionn I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this and anlotn of accountants including AA  Co have blessed the accounting treatmentn None of that will protect Enron if these transactions are ever disclosedn in the bright light of day Please review the late 90s problems ofnWasten Management newsquotennredirectmarketwatchredirectctxMWhttpcustommarketwatchcomcuston mnytcomhtmlcompanyprofileaspsymbWMI  where AA paid 130 millionn plus in litigation re questionable accounting practicesn The overriding basic principle of accounting is that if you explain then accounting treatment to a man in the street would you influence hisn investing decisions Would he sell or buy the stock based on a thoroughn understanding of the facts If so you best present it correctly andorn change the accountingn My concern is that the footnotes dont adequately explain then transactions If adequately explained the investor would know that then entities described in our related party footnote are thinlyncapitalizedn the equity holders have no skin in the game and all the value in then entities comes from the underlying value of the derivativesnunfortunatelyn in this case a big loss AND Enron stock and NP Looking at the stocknwen swapped I also dont believe any other company would have entered inton the equity derivative transactions with us at the same prices or withoutn substantial premiums from Enron In other words the 500 million inn revenue in 2000 would have been much lower How much lowern Raptor looks to be a big bet if the underlying stocks did well then non one would be the wiser If Enron stock did well the stock issuance ton these entities would decline and the transactions would be lessn noticeable All has gone against us The stocks most notably Hanovernthen New Power Company and Avici are underwater to great or lesser degreesn I firmly believe that executive management of the company must have an clear and precise knowledge of these transactions and they must have then transactions reviewed by objective experts in the fields of securitiesnlawn and accounting I believe Ken Lay deserves the right to judge for himselfn what he believes the probabilities of discovery to be and the estimatedn damages to the company from those discoveries and decide one of twon courses of actionn 1 The probability of discovery is low enough and the estimated damagentoon great therefore we find a way to quietly and quickly reverse unwindn write down these positionstransactionsn 2 The probability of discovery is too great the estimated damages tonthen company too great therefore we must quantify develop damagencontainmentn plans and disclosen I firmly believe that the probability of discovery significantlynincreasedn with Skillings shocking departure Too many people are looking for an smoking gunn Summary of Raptor Odditiesn 1 The accounting treatment looks questionablen a Enron booked a 500 million gain from equity derivatives from anrelatedn partyn b That related party is thinly capitalized with no party at risk exceptn Enronn c It appears Enron has supported an income statement gain by an contribution of its own sharesn One basic question The related party entity has lost 500 million in itsn equity derivative transactions with Enron Who bears that loss I cantn find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss Find out who willnlosen this money Who will pay for this loss at the related party entityn If its Enron from our shares then I think we do not have a factnpatternn that would look good to the SEC or investorsn 2 The equity derivative transactions do not appear to be at arms lengthn a Enron hedged New Power Hanover and Avici with the related party atn what now appears to be the peak of the market New Power and Avici haven fallen away significantly since The related party was unable to lay offn this risk This fact pattern is once again very negative for Enronn b I dont think any other unrelated company would have entered intonthesen transactions at these prices What else is going on here What was then compensation to the related party to induce it to enter into suchn transactionsn 3 There is a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor Employees questionn our accounting propriety consistently and constantly This alone is causen for concernn a Jeff McMahon was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of LJM Hen complained mightily to Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thoughtn should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer Three days latern Skilling offered him the CEO spot at Enron Industrial Markets andnnevern addressed the five steps with himn b Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listenn about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJMn c I have heard one managerlevel employee from the principal investmentsn group say I know it would be devastating to all of us but I wish wen would get caught Were such a crooked company The principalninvestmentsn group hedged a large number of their investments with Raptor Thesenpeoplen know and see a lot Many similar comments are made when you ask aboutn these deals Employees quote our CFO as saying that he has a handshaken deal with Skilling that LJM will never lose moneyn 4 Can the general counsel of Enron audit the deal trail and the moneyn trail between Enron and LJMRaptor and its principals Can he look atnLJMn At Raptor If the CFO says no isnt that a problemn Condor and Raptor Workn 1 Postpone decision on filling office of the chair if the currentn decision includes CFO andor CAOn 2 Involve Jim Derrick and Rex Rogers to hire a law firm to investigaten the Condor and Raptor transactions to give Enron attorneyclientnprivilegen on the work product Cant use V  E due to conflict  they providednsomen true sale opinions on some of the dealsn 3 Law firm to hire one of the big 6 but not Arthur Andersen orn PricewaterhouseCoopers due to their conflicts of interest AA  Con Enron PWC LJMn 4 Investigate the transactions our accounting treatment and our futuren commitments to these vehicles in the form of stock NP etc Forn instance In the third quarter we have a 250 million problem with Raptorn 3 NPW if we dont enhance the capital structure of Raptor 3 to commitn more ENE shares By the way in Q 1 we enhanced the Raptor 3 dealn committing more ENE shares to avoid a writedownn 5 Develop cleanup plann a Best case Clean

Personnel to quiz confidentially to determine if Im all wetn a Jeff McMahonn b Mark Koenign c Rick Buyn d Greg Walleyn To put the accounting treatment in perspective I offer the followingn 1 Weve contributed contingent Enron equity to the Raptor entitiesnSincen its contingent we have the consideration given and received at zero Wen do as Causey points out include the shares in our fully dilutedn computations of shares outstanding if the current economics of the dealn imply that Enron will have to issue the shares in the future Thisnimpactsn 20022004 earningsper share projections onlyn 2 We lost value in several equity investments in 2000 500 million ofn lost value These were fairvalue investments we wrote them downn However we also booked gains from our price risk management transactionsn with Raptor recording a corresponding PRM account receivable from then Raptor entities Thats a 500 million related party transaction  itsn20n percent of 2000 IBIT 51 percent of NI pretax 33 percent of NI afterntaxn 3 Credit reviews the underlying capitalization of Raptor reviews then contingent shares and determines whether the Raptor entities will haven enough capital to pay Enron its 500 million when the equity derivativesn expiren 4 The Raptor entities are technically bankrupt the value of then contingent Enron shares equals or is just below the PRM account payablen that Raptor owes Enron Raptors inceptiontodate income statement is an 500 million lossn 5 Where are the equity and debt investors that lost out LJM is whole onn a cashon cash basis Where did the 500 million in value come from Itn came from Enron shares Why havent we booked the transaction as 500n million in a promise of shares to the Raptor entity and 500 million ofn value in our economic interests in these entities Then we would have an writedown of our value in the Raptor entities We have not booked then latter because we do not have to yet Technically we can wait and facen the music

bnJeffn nTodays LA Times editorial  revived the Lockyer quote  It is remarkable and troubling for Enron  that Lockyers political peers  rivals have not taken  him to task for his outrageous remark nor have the major  newspapers  In Todays editorial the usually conservative LA Times  refers to Lockyer as having boosted the rhetoric a notch  Id hate  to witness two or three notchesn nThis lack of  criticism could foreshadow a contagious attitude that powerful Enron is in  fact the one to blame facts be damned  Given Enrons high profile policy  and fundraising ties to the Bush administration and Governor Gray  Davis war with President Bush and Texas energy companies there could be  more turbulence ahead  Fasten your seatbelts and be on the  readyn nKevinn2139262626n nnIMAGE IMAGEIMAGE  tIMAGE

comic relief in this energy crisis has been watching our leaders go at  suppliers and each other like pro wrestlers or Jerry Springer guests        In his State of the State address last  January Gov Gray Davis accused the big private electric power generators  of legalized highway robbery and threatened to seize their plants if  necessary Then he really got angry calling them the biggest snakes in  the world This past week Atty Gen Bill Lockyer boosted the rhetoric a  notch by declaring he would like to personally escort the chairman of  Enron Corp to an 8by10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude  who says Hi my name is Spike honey Meanwhile President Bush and  Vice President Dick Cheney have blamed California for causing its own  problems with a harebrained deregulation scheme and mocked the states  power purchases and conservation programs Its been fun Now its time  for our leaders to act like adults        Davis and Bush always will have their  political differences but the economies of both the state and the nation  are endangered by Californias energy situation These leaders need to  work together as cooperatively as possible starting next week when Bush  makes his first visit to California as president        Davis wrote Bush Wednesday offering to  meet with him during his California visit Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer  said the president looks forward to discussing energy and other issues  Good start Lets hope the conversation is civil and that the civility  spreads       No matter how much California  has been abused by the power companies and it absolutely has the state  still needs them to help solve the crisis caused by shortages of electric  power generation this year and next Usually the biggest targets of  official and public wrath are the investorowned utilities such as  Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas  Electric Co But not this  time because in the view of the state the utilities have been bled dry  by the power generators stratospheric prices The state had to take over  the purchase of power when the generators refused to extend any more  credit to Edison and PGE Legal recourse should be pursued but the  threatening rhetoric needs to subside        State lawmakers are right to be upset  with the White House for refusing to use its authority to set reasonable  temporary wholesale price controls And Davis is justifiably upset with  Bush and with Cheney who said the only solution was to build more power  plantsignoring the fact that the state is building 10 plants now with  five more on the way and that the only way to control wholesale power  rates is for Washington to cap them       If  the state hadnt bought the power the generators would have let the  lights go out Davis needs to deliver that message quietly and  persuasively while Bush is in California And Bush needs to listen  respectfully like an adult   IMAGESearch the archives  of the Los  Angeles Times for similar stories You

httpwwwsfgatecomcgibinarticlecgifileca20010526MN209410DTL   nEnergy executive Kenneth Lay head of powerful Enron Corp quietly courted  Arnold Schwarzenegger Richard Riordan Michael Milken and other luminaries  this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution to Californias  energy crisis  nHis prescription called for more rate increases an end to state and  federal investigations and less rather than more regulation  nLay a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign  contributors hosted a private 90minute meeting in a conference room at the  Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday  nAmong the participants were Milken the former head of the Drexel Burnham  Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in 1990  and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica movie star  Schwarzenegger  nand Riordan the mayor of Los Angeles Schwarzenegger and Riordan have been  courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates  nOne participant who agreed to speak on the condition he not be identified  said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting participants to support  Lays vision and then champion it to officials who are trying to solve the  states energy mess  nPLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATIONnThe source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is  concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with power  markets by either reregulating the system or creating a government authority  to provide electricity Gov Gray Davis signed legislation last week to create  and fund a state power authority that would build buy and run power plants in  California  nTheyre trying to rescue deregulation the source said of Enron  executives They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea  nAt the meeting Enron representatives circulated a fourpage position paper  titled Comprehensive Solution for California which was obtained by The  Chronicle It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the billions in  debt incurred by the states public utilities and that investigations of power  price manipulation and political rhetoric are making matters worse  nThe paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway  electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power  generators and traders  a possibility given credibility in studies by  regulators and economists  nOne of the talking points read Get deregulation right this time   California needs a real electricity market not government takeovers Another  point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving electricity  nINVOLVED IN EARLY DAYSnLay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and  was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment with a  competitive power market system  nLay has created a new kind of company in the process one that essentially  produces nothing but makes money as a middleman buying electricity from  generators and selling it to consumers During the first quarter of this year  Enrons revenues increased 281 percent to 501 billion  nAsked about the purpose of the meeting Karen Denne a spokeswoman for  Enron said she would look into that and then did not return repeated  telephone calls seeking comment One participant said Denne was present at the  meeting  nDC CONNECTIONSnMeanwhile Lays power in Washington is reported to have reached  unprecedented heights According to a story in yesterdays New York Times Lay  supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs regulating  the power industry and even interviewed one of them The story also said Lay  essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman of the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission Curt Hebert if he does not support Lays desire  to further deregulate the nations electricity system Lay denied the  allegation  nAlso in attendance at this weeks meeting were Bruce Karatz chief  executive of home builder Kaufman  Broad Ray Irani chief executive of  Occidental Petroleum and Kevin Sharer chief executive of biotech giant  Amgen  nAmong those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles  Lakers star Earvin Magic Johnson supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton  supporter Ron Burkle and Dennis Tito recently returned from the worlds  first civilian space trip  nMilken through a spokesman confirmed that he attended the meeting but  declined to be interviewed Schwarzenegger could not be reached for comment  through a publicist and Sharer did not return a call yesterday afternoon  nA spokesman for Riordan Peter Hidalgo said the Los Angeles mayor  attended  nbut was not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this  issue  nHis intent is to listen to all sides  nAttached to the Enron handout was a twopage open letter addressed to  Davis and the state Legislature apparently prepared for those who support  Lays position and would be willing to sign their names to it The source who  participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal and  asked a number of questions of Lay but did not agree to champion his agenda  nEmail the writers at cberthelsensfchroniclecom  and  Scott Winokur at swinokursfchroniclecom   2001  San Francisco Chronicle    Page A  1 ,1
bnJeffn nThe attached  Rough  Tumble is an electronic clipping service targeted at California  politicos and policy wonks  It carried the LA Times version of the Lockyer  comments a couple days ago  Today it has the NY Times article on Ken  Lay  Its pretty clear that in the nearterm Enron and its  leadership are at risk of being engulfed in a political firestorm  which bounces from coast to coast gaining strength each step of the  way  n nHowever it  is the longterm challenge that draws my attention  From my research  to date I am left with the strong impression that the Enrons capacity  for acquiring distilling and assessing business information is much  stronger than its abilities with public policy information  n nKen Lay  you and your team have shaped a innovative and entrepreneurial  company rooted in agile arbitrage of business knowledge  Like  Goldman Sachs it is hard for the man on the street to understand  precisely what Enron does  However because of your presence in  businesses that play out daily in homes schools and small  businesses Enron will be scrutinized in a way the Goldman couldnt imagine  in its worst nightmaresn nFrom my  perspective the success of Enrons business model demands a sure  footing in both business and public policy  Going  forward these two areas of expertise need  become intertwined to assure the success of the highly  sophisticated ethical innovative and insightful global corporation  known as Enronn nI would like  to help you succeed with this challenge  I look forward to our  discussionsn nKevinn2139262626n nn

Energy Exec     By JENIFER WARREN Times Staff  Writer        SACRAMENTOIn a  dramatic escalation of energy crisis rhetoric California Atty Gen Bill  Lockyer this week suggested the chairman of a Houstonbased power company  should be locked in a prison cell with an amorous tattooed inmate named  Spike       Lockyer who is investigating  whether energy firms have manipulated prices on the wholesale electricity  market made the comment in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that  appeared Tuesday       I would love to  personally escort Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay to an 8by10 cell  that he could share with a tattooed dude who says Hi my name is Spike  honey  Lockyer said       Enron spokesman  Mark Palmer called the comment counterproductive rhetoric that does not  merit a response       But other industry  representatives denounced the remark as outrageous especially because  neither Lockyers office nor any investigative panel has filed charges  against Enron or other companies       Youd  expect that the states chief legal counsel would file charges first and  make public statements second said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power  Trading Forum an association of energy producers and traders Were very  disappointed with his choice of words which dont exactly fit the profile  of his office       In an interview Tuesday  Lockyer said he decided to ratchet up the commentary to put energy  companies on notice that we are not afraid of them and have the will to  prosecute       What Im trying to do is  let these economic buccaneers understand that if we catch them theyre  going to be prosecuted Lockyer said Just because theyre  multimillionaires and run big corporations it doesnt provide them with  immunity       The attorney general is  investigating whether power company officials tried to maximize profits  through illegal manipulation of prices on the wholesale energy market  Several panels including a state Senate committee and the California  Public Utilities Commission are conducting similar probes        On Tuesday Lockyer announced that three  power companies have agreed to turn over documents subpoenaed months ago  by his investigators The attorney general went to court to obtain the  documents after the companies failed to meet a March 19 deadline to hand  them over       Lockyer said the forthcoming  documents would help his office as it sifts through mountains of evidence  in search of possible violations of antitrust or unfair business practice  laws       Evidence is accumulating that  certainly infers illegal activity Lockyer said But we need to make  sure its compelling and clear enough that you can convince a jury        Lockyer said he singled out Enrons  chairman because the Houston company is the worlds largest energy trader        At least one observer found Lockyers  comments refreshingly candid Harry Snyder a senior advocate of Consumers  Union said Let Lockyer be Lockyer          Times staff

bnThanks for taking time to call  yesterday  Good luck with the Lockyer situation  I truly do believe  that direct and prompt interaction with Lockyer will prove more effective for  Enron than delayed

has never mattered much to Californians Until now        The Vermont senators widely anticipated  decision to abandon his fellow Republicans and put Democrats in control of  the Senate could have big implications for California particularly on  energy and environmental policy lawmakers and lobbyists said Wednesday        The change which Jeffords is expected  to announce today could increase political pressure on the Bush  administration to respond more aggressively to Californias electricity  crisis these insiders said       And it  might force the White House to compromise on key elements of the national  energy policy it unveiled last week In fact the administrations  proposed budget cuts for programs to promote renewable energy were said to  be a factor in Jeffords decision       At  the very least Senate observers said Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif is  likely to get the floor vote she has sought on price controls for  wholesale electricity       That doesnt  necessarily mean that the administrations critics will be able to have  everything their way Even if the Senate approves electricity price caps  for example the measure would face stiff opposition in the GOPdominated  Houseand a likely veto if it made it to the presidents desk        Still a Democratic majority in the  Senate would give Feinstein and other party members a platform to turn up  the political heat on the administration and congressional Republicans on  energy policy       It kicks up the dust  groaned one energy industry lobbyist who requested anonymity        Observed Sen John F Kerry DMass  If President Bushs hardedged conservative approach has in fact caused  the balance to shift towards Democrats in the Senate it will have  profound implications not just for California but for the environment and  our nations energy policy        Environmentalists seemed almost giddy as  they contemplated the possible impact of Jeffords decision on the  policies they care about       All of a  sudden they said it seems less likely that oil exploration will take  place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that recreational  snowmobiles will have free access to Yellowstone National Park or that  the administrations desire to promote nuclear power will be embraced by  Congress       On the other hand it seems  more probable that Congress would approve a new plan for managing a vast  swath of the Sierra Nevada to protect the regions oldest trees consider  legislation to restrict emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants and  protect California from a resurgence of offshore oil drilling        Its stunning how broad the  repercussions are particularly on the environment said Gregory Wetstone  of the Natural Resources Defense Council Were trying not to count our  chickens before they hatch But it will be easier for us in our battles at  least to keep from moving backwards        For instance Jeffords is a chief  advocate of a bill that would regulate carbon dioxide from power plants  And if events play out as expected hell become the new chairman of the  Senate committee with jurisdiction over the issue        Another issue under his purview would be  the twodecade dispute over a proposed repository for the nations spent  nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain in Nevada        Yucca Mountain is a dead turkey  declared Michael Francis of the Wilderness Society        Environmentalists had been worried that  a number of prodevelopment provisions would be packed into appropriation  bills But with Democratic senators in charge that would become less of a  threat they said       Every wacko idea  Republicans have will get a higher level of scrutiny Francis said        The biggest change would be the power of  Senate Democrats to decide which bills will be considered in committees  and which ones will make it to the floor of the Senate for votes        As part of a new Democratic majority  Feinstein and fellow California Democrat Barbara Boxer are likely to gain  leverage with the administration on a number of issues considered  important to the state       That translates  into more federal assistance for California across the board predicted  Steve Maviglio spokesman for Gov Gray Davis        I think it means more attention to our  state for sure Boxer said Right now the president doesnt seem to  give a darn Theyre all looking at California as a Democratic state  Theyre not interested       Feinstein who  has been unable to arrange a meeting with Bush to discuss the energy  crisis may get better treatment if winning Democratic support becomes  more important to the administration She has been regarded as a  bridgebuilder who worked effectively with Republicans in the past        This has not been a warm and friendly  administration she complained Wednesday Theyve got people who know  all the answers and dont want to listen        The White House disputed that In fact  Bush agreed Wednesday to meet with Davis during the presidents first  visit to California next week       Under a  Democratic majority Feinstein would be in line to chair two  subcommittees the military construction panel of the Senate  Appropriations Committee and the technology terrorism and government  information subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee        Boxer would be in line to chair the  subcommittee on Superfund waste control and risk assessment and the  Foreign Relations subcommittee on international operations and terrorism        Maviglio predicted that the effects of  Jeffords expected party defection would be felt immediately        The chairmanship of the Senate Energy  and Natural Resources Committee would be taken away from Frank H  Murkowski RAlaska who has been openly hostile to Californias  plight and handed to Jeff Bingaman DNM who supports Davis request  for electricity price controls according to Maviglio        Democrats have assailed Bushs energy  plan for tilting heavily toward the supply side With Democrats in charge  of the Senate the administration would be more likely to compromise  perhaps beefing up funding for Democratsupported causes such as increased  energy assistance to lowincome households and more aggressive promotion  of conservation and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power     Search  the archives of the Los Angeles Times for similar stories

Shot to Death 1 at Home by Stray Bullet  more            IMAGE IMAGE   Subscribe    By WALTER HAMILTON JEFFERY L RABIN and DARYL KELLEY TIMES  STAFF WRITERS  The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a  preliminary inquiry into whether energy consultants advising Gov Gray  Davis used inside information to trade stocks of power companies doing  business with the state a source with knowledge of the matter said  Monday  The federal agency began its review late last week the  source said in response to a request from California Secretary of State  Bill Jones A Republican rival of Davis Jones charged that stock trading  by consultants may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling  based on information not available to the public  On Friday top  aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had been fired for  possible conflicts of interest between their official positions and their  personal finances As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the capital  Monday Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions about who  in the administration owns energy stocks  Financial disclosure  records filed by the governors spokesman Steve Maviglio show that he  owns between 10000 and 100000 in a Texas company he and his boss have  accused of making obscene profits while California has been on its  knees Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houstonbased Enron Corp in  1996  Its not a crime to own energy stock Maviglio  said  He also owns 300 shares of San Josebased Calpine Corp  which has the largest share of the 43 billion in longterm state power  contracts  Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31 one  day after San Joses mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial  Calpine plant favored by the governor and others Under the terms of  Maviglios purchase the transaction was completed about three weeks later  when the stock reached 40 a share a value of 12000 It has since  fallen in value  I viewed it as a good longterm investment  Maviglio said adding that he purchased the shares for his retirement  account based on publicly available information  The Davis  administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms that it  has leveled at other electricity suppliers such as Enron But  Californias grid operator has identified the company as one of many  energy merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars  The  fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine ranging in value from  several thousand dollars to more than 100000 records  show  Another top Davis administration official legal affairs  secretary Barry Goode disclosed in his economic interest statement that  he recently held between 100000 and 1 million in another outofstate  company accused of multimilliondollar price gouging  In a  statement Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Cos a month after he  began working for the governor in February Goode said the shares were  supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll but his broker  failed to do so  In light of the recent disclosures Secretary of  State Jones said the governor must do more to ensure the public that its  interest comes first  The governor should direct all of his staff  to immediately file updated conflict of interest statements that reflect  current holdings and any activity since their last statement of economic  interest was filed said Jones who is seeking the GOP nomination for  governor  Word of the SECs entry into Californias energy problems  comes as the governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for  the quick and broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him  through the crisis  In his written request to the SEC Jones said  that recently filed disclosure documents showed that at least one  consultant bought and sold shares of two energy companies within the same  month raising a red flag about the possibility of insider  trading  State law prohibits officials from participating in  decisions involving their personal financial interests  The five  consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones letter  delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday It was  not clear which individuals are the focus of the SECs inquiry or whether  the agencys review would result in any charges  Two of the former  traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by federal  investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider  trading  But William Mead fired Thursday said it is no mystery  why so many of his colleagues owned Calpine stock  Mead said he  bought it 2 12 years ago and made so much money he recommended it to his  colleagues last year while they all still worked for the nowdefunct  California Power Exchange in Alhambra Calpine power was not traded on  that exchange so there was no conflict of interest he said  Mead  and three other energy tradershired by the state in February and  Marchwere terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying  power for the state from Calpine while owning the companys stock Fired  traders Herman Leung Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the  date of their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state  required to be filed only two weeks ago  But Im sure they bought  it while they were still at the power exchange because thats when we  discussed it Mead said It was kind of like a hobby Im sure it wasnt  done with the intent to manipulate  Former trader Elaine Griffin  who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two weeks ago to take another  job said she didnt know she owned energy securities until she checked  with her financial advisor July 13 just before leaving her state  job  Griffin said she and her husband own about 10000 worth of  Calpine stock in individual retirement accounts managed by their advisor  who bought the stock Feb 1 without their knowledge she said after  research found it to be a good investment  I kind of feel like  weve been used for political reasons Griffin said We would have  disclosed anything right at first but they never asked  As a  trader Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the state  but only at market prices  Meanwhile two Democratic political  consultants who helped Davis polish his image after the ongoing energy  crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet have agreed to accept no  payment for their work as part of an outofcourt settlement of a taxpayer  lawsuit  Tom Hiltachk a lawyer for conservative antitax activist  Lewis Uhler said the settlement was reached last Friday after  negotiations with lawyers for communications consultants Mark Fabiani and  Chris Lehane  Now they will not receive one red cent said  Hiltachk Very simply Mr Fabiani and Mr Lehane have agreed to cease all  activities for the governor to accept no payments for their services and  to basically get out of the consulting business with the  governor  As his part of the agreement Hiltachk said Uhler  withdrew his lawsuit Monday morning  Uhler had filed a lawsuit  against the two consultants and Controller Kathleen Connell in June  contending that they should not receive any payments because of a conflict  of interest The two men also did consulting work for financially troubled  Southern California Edison which was seeking help from Davis and the  Legislature  Connell a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who  has been at odds with Davis since he endorsed an opponent had held up the  payments pending the outcome of the lawsuit  Under an agreement  with Davis the men were to have been paid 30000 a month for six  months  Fabiani and Lehane could not be reached for  comment    Times staff writers Nancy Vogel and Virginia  Ellis in Sacramento and Robert

executive orders requiring outofstate utilities to supply power to California And everyone is wrong to listen to Californians whine about electricity deregulation nThere never was any deregulation The California Public Utilities Commission merely changed its regulations which apparently werent stupid enough to meet Golden State standards Under Californias 1996 reregulation plan electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors They were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden to enter into any longterm power supply contracts Retail electricity prices were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until March 2002 nThis is like requiring AP to sell you porterhouse at 2 a pound no matter what the price of beef on the hoof Imagine how many steaks there would be and how many supermarkets Go to one of those boardedup grocery stores purchase a phantom Tbone screw it into a ceiling fixture and try to light your house Youre in California nCalifornians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every dimension of the free market Interesting that the Information Economy is centered in a place thats immune to information The free market is a yardstick and Californians got smacked with it Mideast oil jitters cold weather natural gas price spikes and the plain unpredictable freedom of the free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California utilities to go 12 billion into the red nCalifornias governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini beach brain In a January 8 speech to the state legislature Davis proposed creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones He threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids He called for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld electricity from California markets And he said the states universities and community colleges would build cogenerating plants and become energy independent With gas produced by the cafeteria food Gray Davis sounded like Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves Everyone should understand that there are other more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I have to Davis declaimed nTake is the key word Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into some cheap electricity Hoggish California power companies went along because the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor According to the Los Angeles Times during the first 28 months of the scheme Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made 20 billion from the legally required markup between wholesale and retail electric prices nCalifornians want to snatch that money back Consumer advocates around California said it did not matter that the utilities were returning investments to their shareholders reported the January 31 Washington Post They took the money and ran said state senator John Burton As opposed to Californians who took the electricity and rollerbladed Now the juice and the jack are both gone and the California legislature has had to pass a bill authorizing 10 billion to try to clean up the mess nBut the Californians could still pull a scam The bill mandates longterm power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be The hope one guesses is that Congress or the President or somebody will let the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower nIt would be wrong to call Californians stupid Theyre sleazy too nR J ORourke is the Cato Institutes H L Mencken

nwrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring outofstate nutilities to supply power to California And everyone is wrong to listen to nCalifornians whine about electricity deregulation nThere never was any deregulation The California Public Utilities Commission nmerely changed its regulations which apparently werent stupid enough to nmeet Golden State standards Under Californias 1996 reregulation plan nelectric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors They nwere required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden nto enter into any longterm power supply contracts Retail electricity prices nwere lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until March 2002 nThis is like requiring AP to sell you porterhouse at 2 a pound no matter nwhat the price of beef on the hoof Imagine how many steaks there would be nand how many supermarkets Go to one of those boardedup grocery stores npurchase a phantom Tbone screw it into a ceiling fixture and try to light nyour house Youre in California nCalifornians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every ndimension of the free market Interesting that the Information Economy is ncentered in a place thats immune to information The free market is a nyardstick and Californians got smacked with it Mideast oil jitters cold nweather natural gas price spikes and the plain unpredictable freedom of the nfree market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California nutilities to go 12 billion into the red nCalifornias governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini nbeach brain In a January 8 speech to the state legislature Davis proposed ncreating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones He nthreatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids He called nfor laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld nelectricity from California markets And he said the states universities and ncommunity colleges would build cogenerating plants and become energy nindependent With gas produced by the cafeteria food Gray Davis sounded nlike Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves Everyone should understand nthat there are other more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I nhave to Davis declaimed nTake is the key word Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into nsome cheap electricity Hoggish California power companies went along because nthe stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor nAccording to the Los Angeles Times during the first 28 months of the scheme nPacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made 20 billion from the nlegally required markup between wholesale and retail electric prices nCalifornians want to snatch that money back Consumer advocates around nCalifornia said it did not matter that the utilities were returning ninvestments to their shareholders reported the January 31 Washington Post nThey took the money and ran said state senator John Burton As opposed to nCalifornians who took the electricity and rollerbladed Now the juice and nthe jack are both gone and the California legislature has had to pass a bill nauthorizing 10 billion to try to clean up the mess nBut the Californians could still pull a scam The bill mandates longterm npower contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be The nhope one guesses is that Congress or the President or somebody will let nthe state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower nIt would be wrong to call Californians stupid Theyre sleazy too nR J ORourke is the Cato Institutes H L Mencken Research Fellow and is nforeign affairs desk chief for Rolling Stone He is author of several nbestselling books including Parliament

bIf youve been wondering where Daviss 9 billion overcharge number number ncomes from attached is  the apparent basis of the number which was from a nstudy prepared by Hildebrandt of the CAISO It was apparently released on the nCAISO site on 621  nnNote that the 9billion includes bilateral trade sold to any party  However nHildebrandt cannot say who the supplier is unless DWR CAISO or the PX was nthe buyer for those buyers he presumably has detailed data  Thus he can nascribe overcharges to specific jurisdictional generators for only 54 nbillion of the 9billion total  He does not show what specific parties are nattrributable to the 54 billion   In an earlier study on just ISO RT nstrategic bidding supplier names were released inadvertantly by CAISOnnFinally as in previous CAISO studies a significant fraction of overcharges napprox 3 billion  comes from before the refundeffective date of 10100nnAlan Comnes,1

11 x01 House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy nTauzin RLA and Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton nRTX today sent the following letter to California Governor Gray Davis nJuly 11 2001nThe Honorable Gray Davis nGovernor nState of California nState Capitol nSacramento California 95814 nDear Governor Davis n As you know the Energy and Commerce Committee recently nconsidered legislation containing several targeted measures to assist nCalifornia in resolving its energy supply crisis One of these measures was na temporary x01safe harborx018 provision effective only upon the California nGovernorx01s request to protect critical extended emergency operation of npowerplants from challenges under the Clean Air Act n During the course of six hearings the Subcommittee on Energy and nAir Quality held on the California electric crisis including two hearings on ndraft legislation Members of the Committee repeatedly told California nofficials that these plants were vulnerable to legal challenge even with nwritten x01agreementsx018 for extended operation between state air officials and nthe powerplants Nevertheless California officials testifying or providing ninformation on behalf of your state and your citizens claimed that such a nsafe harbor was not necessary n I fear events have proven that on this important matter the nconcerns expressed by Members of our Committee were valid and that our ninterpretation of the legal jeopardy faced by California was accurate On nJune 19th several community groups filed a lawsuit in federal court against nthree electric generating units in California all located at the Potrero npower plant site alleging multiple violations of the Clean Air Act for nemergency extended operation On the same day the City and County of San nFrancisco filed formal notice that it would also pursue legal action against nthe three Potrero units All parties involved in the litigation strongly nassert that the extended operation agreement between state air officials and nthe Potrero power plant does nothing to prevent them from pursuing all navailable legal remedies under federal and state law n The legal action against the units located at the Potrero power nplant claims that extended operation violates limits contained in federal air npermits and seeks fines potentially amounting to millions of dollars nUnderstandably as a result of this potentially huge fine the operator of nthe Potrero power plant has filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulatory nCommission to clarify that it will not be required to operate the three ngenerating units even during periods of electrical emergency Thus the nmere filing of this lawsuit could have a nearterm impact of the amount of npower available in California n Perhaps even more troubling is our understanding that substantial namounts of electric power produced by peaking plants and other facilities in nCalifornia could also be subject to similar legal action The California nIndependent System Operator lists 31 units representing 1430 megawatts of npeaking units which are subject to legal limits on their total hours of noperation In addition several new units are being brought online this nsummer without required Clean Air Act control equipment According to nincomplete information we received from the California Air Resources Board nCARB 37 generating units have been identified in California which may nexhaust allowable annual operating hours contained in their air permits prior nto this summerx01s peak demand period These units may represent up to 2 of ngeneration approximately the critical operating reserve shortfall of a Stage nIII electric emergency n Although presented with written requests for information from the nCommittee on April 2 2001 CARB could not or would not provide the Committee nwith precise information on units that may have been offline due to permit nlimits a projection of the number of generating units that will face permit nconstraints that could cause such units to be offline the amount of ngeneration associated with these facilities the possible impact of these nunits on system reliability and additional information related to air nemissions from facilities that will be operating under x01modifiedx018 nconditions We believe that in the face of the pending legal action it is neven more important that such information be accurately and objectively ndetermined n As we mentioned above over several months in the spring and nearly summer of this year the Committee sought Californiax01s support of an nextremely narrow safe harbor provision to protect the extended operation of ncertain powerplants Regrettably the Committee did not receive any support nfrom your administration for such changes to the law as represented by the ntestimony and responses attached to this letter Instead witnesses nrepresenting California claimed such a legal safe harbor for emergency ngeneration was unnecessary  even if it could only be granted during periods nof emergency and upon your personal request to the Environmental Protection nAgency EPA n It appears now that citizen groups in California  as well as nthe City and County of San Francisco  do not believe that the actions taken nby you your state agencies and local air quality districts are legal The npending litigation challenges the very agreements which California previously nclaimed granted sufficient legal x01flexibilityx018 to keep these units running nduring times of emergency It is time then to reconsider this issue n So that the Committee may understand the extent of this critical nsituation and respond accordingly we would ask for your consideration of the nfollowing n1 We would urge you to reply fully to the Committeex01s earlier requests that nCARB specifically identify each generating unit and power plant that is in njeopardy of exceeding limitations contained in the Clean Air Act and thus npotentially subject to the citizen suit provisions of the Act We should nhave a clear idea of the power production which is at risk n2 In view of the fact that we have moved from the world of legal theory ninto the world of legal fact and several California generating units are now nbeing sued under authorities contained in the Clean Air Act we ask whether nyou will now favor creating in federal law a limited environmentallyneutral nsafe harbor for these essential units which could only be effectuated upon nyour request to EPA n3 Finally we would ask that if you support such legislation that you work nwith our Committee so that we can truly try and resolve this issue in a ntargeted provision which helps ensure the lights stay on in California this nsummer n Thank you in

understanding of the national embarrassmentnCalifornia is perpetrating with electricity deregulationnnx01The next thing you know they will be taking property and forcingnutilities to build power plants and transmissionx018 he mused between sipsnof Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers  x01Come to thinknof it Dave they did say something about that Yeahx018 I recallednx01Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing thenISO or the utilities to build peakers and not let the market buildnthem  I canx01t remember if that was before or after he suggested to

believe in them but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW tradenand without any notice or advanced warning the price in the Midwestnmarket went against mex018 Dave recalled  x01I called everyone who I tradednwith and they had nothing  I finally called XXXXX and I asked whatnwill it cost for 50 MWx018nnx01Why didnx01t you ask for 300x018 I wondered  x01I didnx01t want to show him mynposition  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position  Ask forn50 firstx018 Dave chidednnx01What happenedx018 x01Oh they offered to sell for 150MWH  I said Ix01dntake it and then said I needed another fifty  He asked 300  I tooknthat and he priced the next 50 MW at 600x018 lamented Dave  x01He justnwanted to see how far he could push me Thatx01s what I mean when I saynthe traders are jigging itx018nnx01But Dave you old communist your forgetting the trading function isnwhat mitigates the risk The traders are the in between people who guessnat the price  Sometimes they guess right and sometimes they guessnwrong  But the damage or the reward is on their book not passed onnto the ultimate consumer It has nothing to do with the marginal cost ofna generating plantx018nnAnd there you

they cant affordnthe extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon  The costs are passed along to thenconsumer without pause  Granted there are differences between thenunleaded market and the electricity market in

we should keep an eyenout for FERC Chairman Hoecker to do something really  Censoredn for political reasons  Given no Commission meetings til Septembernthe only way to act is by unanimous consent so I would hope he cant donall that muchx018nn Things in the Peoplex01s Republic of Californian  The ISO Replies to the EOB ReportnnSeveral of you people commented to me that the ISOx01s reply to thenPUCEOB report was very good  I decided to excerpt the best sections ofnit for the Burrito  The full document can be found on the ISOx01snwebsitennx01 the PUCEOB Report asserts that the suspected activities ofncertain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading tonthe Bay Area blackouts the following day In fact the events of June 13nand June 14 were completely independent of one another The voltageninstability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alonen exceptionally high loads insufficient generation in the specificnlocal area and transmission constraints that prevented the import ofngeneration from outside the areannx01The Report states that the ISO x01never triedx018 to call upon consumers tonreduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts In fact the ISOnhad in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed tonreduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program undernwhich customers have agreed through a prior solicitation to curtailnenergy use in exchange for a feennx01The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid bynx01purchasersx01 of energy as a result of the recent price spikes eg 12nbillion in the month of June alone These assertions leave one with thenmistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid bynthe UDCs andor passed through to customers However in determining thentotal cost of energy one must determine the impact of any forwardncontracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energynmarkets These contracts which are designed to x01lockinx018 a specificnprice in advance of realtime or near realtime market activities arenspecifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility andnare standard in all commodities markets We have reason to believe thatnsome of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of thenrecent price spikesnnx01In a similar vein the reports asserts that California x01might wellx018nhave saved 110 million dollars had a 250 price cap been in place innMay and June This assertion assumes that all energy purchases wouldnhave been made at or below the 250 bid cap In fact during times ofnpeak demand when all of the statex01s generation has been exhausted thenISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation In ordernto secure the necessary power the ISO must purchase on a bilateralnbasis this energy from resources located outside of the ISOx01s controlnareannx01The Report asserts that California power markets x01are not nowncompetitivex018 and implies erroneously in our view that this is thennormal state of affairs It is not The Market Surveillance Committeenhas noted that x01market power in the California energy market appears tonarisenprimarily during periods of peak demandx018 and warned that demand growthnwould increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000nnx01The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a selfinterestednboard and not to the citizens of California This simply is not thencase The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act andnto the rules and regulations of FERC which dictate in part thatnwholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the publicninterest The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed andnapproved by FERC Every change to our market design and virtually everynaspect of the ISOx01s business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERCnThe FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by thenstate agencies and such agencies have in fact been active participantsnin the FERC proceedingsnnx01The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affectednby restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have madenCalifornia more vulnerable to supply shortages This assertion isnunfounded Significant load growth in California and neighboring statesncoupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in bothngeneration and transmission have caused this vulnerabilitynRestructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many foldnOnly by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval andnsiting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements willnthis significant shortage be addressedx018nn Things in the Peoplex01s Republic of Californian  Reflections on a Day of Senate HearingsnnIf you want to imagine a scary sight imagine then twelve Californianlegislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongsnof electric restructuring  Also imagine as if you are in the TwilightnZone witnesses that are slow on their feet and reckless in theirnfacts  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterdayx01s Joint

the show began with CEC Commissioner BillnKeese  Mr Keese has one story and regardless how well he tells itnand he does it is always the same story  It is the heat storm storynOne can imagine in the

by the sudden pricenhikes  YikesnnKeese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7 butnin neighboring Arizona the reserve margin is 1 or 2  Mr Keesencorrectly pointed out that electric power is not solely a Californianproblem it is a regional problem  One member of the Committee askednwhat the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting andnconstruction processnnKeese referred to Governor Gray Davisx01 Executive Order issued last weeknto which the CEC plans to respond soon date uncertain that lays out an6 month permitting time line  The six months are enough if thenapplicant has the land secured zoning okayed transmission access andnair offsets  Hmmmmmm  That alone might take six months before you getnto the CECnnThe next panel included Mr Kahn

Mr Smith came innplace of Mr Hoecker thank the Lord  Mr Smith put into FERCeese whatnthese 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other waynThe 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare thenwholesale market as noncompetitive and then ask the generators to givenback the money they over collected  When can we do that  Mr Smithnanswered as only a FERC attorney can answer  There is a process  Itntakes time  You must have evidence  FERC uses a threepart criterianfor assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable  Itx01snbased on market concentration and dominance not the existence of highnprices  You would have to sue FERC in federal court and the best youncould hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand fromnthe US Court of AppealsnnSlowly the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12  They werenstumped  Herr Hair Peace screamed couldnx01t you Mr Smith of FERCntoday use your authority to declare the markets noncompetitive thatngenerators who had market based rates have exercised market power andnretroactively implement a 250 rate cap across the Western regionnLike a wheezing accordion Mr Smith played back and forth the familiarnstrains of music like a solo street musician on the corner  Back andnforth the process the process the process  There have been times innthe past I hated the process at

letter to Gov DavisnnnnCommittee News Release The Committee on Energy and Commerce WJ Billy Tauzin  Chairman  Chairmen Tauzin Barton Urge Gov Davis To Respond Immediately to Inquiries   Washington July 11  House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin RLA and Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton RTX today sent the following letter to California Governor Gray Davis  July 11 2001 The Honorable Gray Davis  Governor  State of California  State Capitol  Sacramento California 95814  Dear Governor Davis              As you know the Energy and Commerce Committee recently considered legislation containing several targeted measures to assist California in resolving its energy supply crisis  One of these measures was a temporary safe harbor provision effective only upon the California Governors request to protect critical extended emergency operation of powerplants from challenges under the Clean Air Act              During the course of six hearings the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality held on the California electric crisis including two hearings on draft legislation Members of the Committee repeatedly told California officials that these plants were vulnerable to legal challenge even with written agreements for extended operation between state air officials and the powerplants  Nevertheless California officials testifying or providing information on behalf of your state and your citizens claimed that such a safe harbor was not necessary              I fear events have proven that on this important matter the concerns expressed by Members of our Committee were valid and that our interpretation of the legal jeopardy faced by California was accurate  On June 19th several community groups filed a lawsuit in federal court against three electric generating units in California all located at the Potrero power plant site alleging multiple violations of the Clean Air Act for emergency extended operation  On the same day the City and County of San Francisco filed formal notice that it would also pursue legal action against the three Potrero units  All parties involved in the litigation strongly assert that the extended operation agreement between state air officials and the Potrero power plant does nothing to prevent them from pursuing all available legal remedies under federal and state law              The legal action against the units located at the Potrero power plant claims that extended operation violates limits contained in federal air permits and seeks fines potentially amounting to millions of dollars  Understandably as a result of this potentially huge fine the operator of the Potrero power plant has filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to clarify that it will not be required to operate the three generating units even during periods of electrical emergency  Thus the mere filing of this lawsuit could have a nearterm impact of the amount of power available in California              Perhaps even more troubling is our understanding that substantial amounts of electric power produced by peaking plants and other facilities in California could also be subject to similar legal action  The California Independent System Operator lists 31 units representing 1430 megawatts of peaking units which are subject to legal limits on their total hours of operation  In addition several new units are being brought online this summer without required Clean Air Act control equipment  According to incomplete information we received from the California Air Resources Board CARB 37 generating units have been identified in California which may exhaust allowable annual operating hours contained in their air permits prior to this summers peak demand period  These units may represent up to 2 of generation approximately the critical operating reserve shortfall of a Stage III electric emergency              Although presented with written requests for information from the Committee on April 2 2001 CARB could not or would not provide the Committee with precise information on units that may have been offline due to permit limits a projection of the number of generating units that will face permit constraints that could cause such units to be offline the amount of generation associated with these facilities the possible impact of these units on system reliability and additional information related to air emissions from facilities that will be operating under modified conditions   We believe that in the face of the pending legal action it is even more important that such information be accurately and objectively determined              As we mentioned above over several months in the spring and early summer of this year the Committee sought Californias support of an extremely narrow safe harbor provision to protect the extended operation of certain powerplants  Regrettably the Committee did not receive any support from your administration for such changes to the law as represented by the testimony and responses attached to this letter  Instead witnesses representing California claimed such a legal safe harbor for emergency generation was unnecessary  even if it could only be granted during periods of emergency and upon your personal request to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA               It appears now that citizen groups in California  as well as the City and County of San Francisco  do not believe that the actions taken by you your state agencies and local air quality districts are legal  The pending litigation challenges the very agreements which California previously claimed granted sufficient legal flexibility to keep these units running during times of emergency  It is time then to reconsider this issue              So that the Committee may understand the extent of this critical situation and respond accordingly we would ask for your consideration of the following  1 We would urge you to reply fully to the Committees earlier requests that CARB specifically identify each generating unit and power plant that is in jeopardy of exceeding limitations contained in the Clean Air Act and thus potentially subject to the citizen suit provisions of the Act  We should have a clear idea of the power production which is at risk  2 In view of the fact that we have moved from the world of legal theory into the world of legal fact and several California generating units are now being sued under authorities contained in the Clean Air Act we ask whether you will now favor creating in federal law a limited environmentallyneutral safe harbor for these essential units which could only be effectuated upon your request to EPA  3 Finally we would ask that if you support such legislation that you work with our Committee so that we can truly try and resolve this issue in a targeted provision which helps ensure the lights stay on in California this summer              Thank you in advance for your consideration of our requests Sincerely WJ Billy Tauzin Chairman Energy and Commerce Committee Joe Barton  Chairman Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality  Peter Sheffield

bFYI  From todays Post  Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contractsnnBestnJeffnnFinancial nCalifornia Changes Stance on Refunds Two Sides Far Apart In Energy TalksnPeter Behrn  n07062001 nThe Washington Post nFINAL nPage E01 nCopyright 2001 The Washington Post Co All Rights Reserved nCalifornia officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity  saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate 43 billion in longterm electricity contracts that the state signed this year nGov Gray Davis D said part of the 89 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the longterm contracts whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis nWeve made suggestions weve offered various ways in which people could get us 89 billion Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money However you want to do it its just got to net out close to 89 billion nThe new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L Wagner Jr according to sources close to the negotiations nYesterday Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise nWhat Im trying to do is get people in a settlement mood Wagner told reporters In the event were unable to do that Friday at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday nWagner FERCs chief administrative judge has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California s largest utility drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at swords point with generators that help keep the states lights on nLast Friday Wagner rebuked Daviss chief representative Michael Kahn chairman of California Independent Grid Operator  the states power grid manager  indicating that the states demand for nearly 9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high sources said nWagners settlement conference which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides is closed to the public and media nWagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a joke that the parties might as well wear clown suits according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks nBut he has also criticized the generators and power marketers led by Reliant Energy Inc Williams Energy Services Duke Energy and Southern Co for failing to make serious settlement offers these sources said The suppliers have offered to refund 600 million provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds sources said nWagners leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERCs commissioners FERC has tentatively called for 124 million in refunds but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California s electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure some energy analysts believe nDaviss tactical change offering to make the longterm contracts part of an overall settlement comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals nCalifornia s energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan which relied heavily on shortterm power purchases at volatile spot market prices When energy costs shot upward last summer so did the states electricity bills nIn response Daviss aide S David Freeman and his staff began negotiating longterm power contacts with suppliers The 43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about 70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years nThats well under the average of 250 per megawatthour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year but above current power prices  and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade energy analysts say nA new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the states controversial demand for the 89 billion refund Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a refund because the deals were reached under commercial duress according to sources close to Wagners negotiations nIndustry supporters say Daviss refund figure is impossible to justify Theres no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be said Michael Zenger California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates nThe states advocates counter that if FERC enforced a just and reasonable standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the 9 billion figure nIts not rocket science but it does require the regulators to regulate said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid nThose polaropposite views have left both sides in Wagners conference room billions of dollars apart as the talks approached their final weekend sources said ,1

bnnRay Alvarez brought to my attention today a news item indicating that the Congressional Budget Office released a report earlier this week entitled Causes and Lessons of the California Electricity Crisis  The 30 page report is available on the home page of the CBOs web site at wwwcbogov  I have quickly read through the summary and it is largely favorable  For example the summary saysnnMuch of the blame for Californias electricity crisis attaches to the states restructuring plan  but not to its objective electricity deregulation   But deregulation itself did not fail rather it was never achievednnThe restructuring plan did not remove sufficient barriers on both the supply and demand sides of the market to allow competition to work  in part because it was not designed tonnEven without restructuring Californias electric utilities would have faced a difficult challenge in meeting the demand for power and holding down prices in 2000nnConsequently wholesale electricity prices were higher than they probably would have been in either a traditionally regulated market or a more fully deregulated marketnnLongterm solutions to Californias electricity problems will most likely require three changes removing barriers to the addition of generating capacity eliminating bottlenecks in the electricity transmission system and removing regulatory restrictions on the sale of power throughout the broad western marketnnOn the negative side the report summary does state that some generators may also have withheld supplies at certain times to boost prices even more and the plans auction system for the spot market appears to have created strong incentives for suppliers to bid strategically in a way that raised wholesale pricesn,1
bnnYesterday the Federal Trade Commission issued a staff report on electricity restructuring issues  It is an update of the July 2000 report done at the request of House Energy Chairman Tauzin and Subcommittee Chairman Barton  They requested the report be updated  A summary of the report and the full 80 page text is on the FTC web site at wwwftcgov on the upper left side of the home pagennI read the summary and will read the balance  So far so good  It basically says that even states that have opened up to retail competition are in transition with a hybrid of regulation and competition thus the expected benefits of competition have not yet emerged  However the report states that nothing to date indicates that competition once the transition period is over will not produce additional benefits for consumers  The reports major conclusion is that competitive wholesale markets are important to achieving effective competition in retail markets  nnThe summary includes something that sounds promising on RTO policy saying And as wholesale and retail markets become regional governing policies and jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and retail competition to be successful,1

represents a complete turnabout fromnwhat was expected when California deregulated its energynmarket on March 31 1998 which opened electricitynpricing to competition California tried to give itsnutilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulatingnfaster than other states and by creating a mechanism tonallow investorowned utilities such as PGE and Edisonnto quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customersnunder the old regulatory systemnnTo do this the state legislature set retail rates atnhigh levels which at first generated fat surpluses fornthe utilities As the money piled up utilities used itnto pay down debts for generation facilities that werenotherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world Bynthe end of this June PGE and Edison together hadncollected more than 12 billion and were on track tonfinish paying down debts well ahead of the March 31n2002 deadline set by the legislature At that pointnrate freezes were to end and retail prices were tonfluctuate

It sounds like this consultants findings are being questioned by many nin the industry including by the CAISOnnPortland OreBased Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity NeedsnDan McSwain  North County Times Escondido Califnn October 17 2000 nnnnOct 13PORTLAND OreA private investigation of state power markets has ncome to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating ncapacity this summernnThe state enjoyed a 32 percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared nand the states power manager declared 36 separate power emergencies nbecause California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage naccording to the investigationnnThe author of the investigations preliminary report Portlandbased neconomist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough said at a nconference of analysts power traders and electricity industry regulators nThursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies nmanipulated the production of power from June through August to create a nfalse shortage and push up pricesnnThe Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example it ran at well nbelow its full capacity for much of June even though wholesale power prices n and consumer electricity bills  shot to well above the generating nplants cost of productionnnThe actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an nanalysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency which monitors nemissionsnnWe are seeing a lot of undergeneration McCullough said This is market npower in actionnnMarket power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market nparticipants  in this case suppliers  to influence pricesnnMany of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed ntheir belief that supply shortages were very real this summer and ncontributed to high prices but several participants said deregulation has nreduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts nMainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal nagencies including the EPAnnConventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego nCounty are scantnnEncinas operators a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc and NRG nEnergy Inc called Cabrillo Power confirmed that the power plant had no nabnormal maintenance problems The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said nWednesday that the power plant was well within its statemandated pollution nlimitsnnBut David Lloyd the corporate secretary of Cabrillo denied that the Encina nplant has been used to game the San Diego County power marketsnnThat cant possibly be right Lloyd said of McCulloughs analysis In nNorth County we were right on the ragged edge of being off an emergency nshutdown because of heavy outputnnWithout knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off nI cant comment Lloyd saidnnWe certainly dont want to be accused of anything wrongful he said We ndont have that much power in California and for us to be shutting down in nCalifornia to push up the price somewhere else doesnt make sense for us We nwant to run all we can when the prices are highnnElectricity prices have soared to record levels since May resulting in a ndoubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the 12 million ncustomers of San Diego Gas  Electric Co and causing an estimated 5 billion nin losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas  ElectricnnState lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with na retail rate cap but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow nbeyond 300 million if high wholesale prices persistnnNo fewer than five private state and federal investigations are under way to nassess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western nstates The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies nwhich produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit nderegulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright nmanipulation in order to increase profitsnnInquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission Electricity nOversight Board and attorney general along with a Federal Energy Regulatory nCommission investigation were launched in July and August Staff ninvestigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they nare still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market datannMcCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium nof large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate nthe price spikes His effort is thought to be the first to complete an nexhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount nof electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that nwas actually usednnChief among McCulloughs findings was that demand for power was lower this nsummer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council na federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web nof power transmission lines that connect California to 13 other Western nstates British Columbia and northern MexiconnMcCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North nCounty Times and the initial reaction of the states energy community was none of deep skepticismnnEPA data is notoriously unreliable said Frank Wolak a Stanford professor nand the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California nIndependent System Operator the agency that manages the state grid and which nhas paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer To gauge the actual noutput of power plants that burn fossil fuel McCullough used emissions data nfrom the EPAnnGreed would get the best of anybody Wolak said I found a lot of hours nwhere instate generators were exceeding nameplate capacity These guys were ncranking it outnnWolak in a study of power markets for the system operator did conclude nhowever that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was nthe major cause of higher prices this summernnAt the conference in Portland most of the panelists did not openly criticize nMcCulloughs analysis but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing nhigher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real nshortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western statesnnLow hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures nin the Southwest were blamed for limiting Californias ability to import nelectricitynnOthers said state and federal regulators along with market participants nthemselves wont really know what happened until more experts look at hard nmarket information that is in short supplynnRon Eachus the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission said nmarket information is routinely withheld from regulators the public and nbuyers of electricity but is shared among power generators and trading ncompaniesnnIf the market is sharing it with themselves but not us I dont buy that nEachus saidnnTim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America the nlargest marketer and trader of electricity in the world Enron takes the nunique stand that more information which has been labeled proprietary by ncompanies such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is nselling for should be made available instantly to the marketsnnIs there a smoking gun out there or are

bCalifornia Officials Investigate Electric Megawatt LaunderingnSteve Johnson  San Jose Mercury News Califnn October 31 2000 nnnnOct 30While investigating this summers stunning spike in electricity nprices state authorities have heard stories about a curious phenomenonnnOn days when the weather is hot batches of power generated in California are nsold to other states A little later in the day similar amounts of power are nsold back to California  but at much higher pricesnnThe question is is it the same power If so that could be megawatt nlaundering  a multicompany conspiracy to evade Californias wholesale nprice cap which covers power generated in California but not power sold into nCalifornia from elsewherennWorried that such transactions could be costing consumers millions of ndollars several energy specialists raised concerns about megawatt laundering nduring a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hearing a month ago in San nDiego And earlier this month state Sen Steve Peace DLa Mesa  who nhelped lead the push to deregulate electricity sales in California  nformally asked the commission to investigate the practice which he termed npotentially illegal market coordinationnnBut an unconfirmed news report last week said the federal agency had nconcluded that generators had not abused the market And others say concerns nabout megawatt laundering are exaggeratednnAmong them is Jan SmutnyJones executive director of the Independent Energy nProducers Association a powerfirm trade group and chairman of the nIndependent System Operator which oversees most of Californias power gridnnWhile acknowledging that such laundering is possible SmutnyJones said there nis no evidence it is actually occurring or is widespreadnnThis is one of those things thats turning into an urban legend he said nI dont want to characterize this as a significant problemnnEven some critics of the way power is purchased in California concede that nmost of what has been labeled megawatt laundering probably reflects nothing nmore sinister than the ability of some entrepreneurs to take advantage of a ngood deal when they see onennNonetheless they see evidence that at least some Californiaproduced power nis being sold out of and back into the state at a higher price And they nblame that on loopholes in the system that they say ought to be closed nbecause the transactions are helping to drive up the cost of powernnThe Independent System Operator invites this type of activity said Frank nWolak a Stanford economist who chairs the nonprofit corporations market nsurveillance committee which has warned of the potential for megawatt nlaundering in at least two reports this year The thing that makes all these nproblems go is the fact that the ISO has said Well pay whatever it takes nto keep the lights on and thats screwing consumers big timennIn 1998 when the states energy markets were deregulated it was generally nassumed that opening up the sale of electricity to competition would make npower less expensive As a precaution however officials at the Independent nSystem Operator instituted wholesale price caps which they lowered twice nthis summer to help keep a lid on costs On July 1 this year they reduced nthe cap from 750 per megawatt per hour to 500 one megawatt being nsufficient power for 1000 homes Then on Aug 7 they cut it to 250nnUnfortunately things havent worked out the way officials had hoped nWholesale prices rose dramatically this year And while a freeze on retail nutility rates has temporarily shielded Pacific Gas  Electric Co customers nfrom those soaring costs home electricity prices have tripled in San Diego nwhere a similar freeze already has come offnnIn the process some generators learned that all it takes to get around the nstates wholesale price caps is a basic understanding of how the market nworks One of the best ways to get top dollar they learned was to hold off nselling their electricity until the Independent System Operator issues what nis known as an outofmarket call for energy which amounts to an emergency nrequest for electricitynnFrom May through September this year the overall price of power in the state naveraged less than 125 per megawatt hour according to authorities But over nthe same period power sold in response to outofmarket calls averaged more nthan 430nnDuring the summer when energy use is at a maximum California typically nimports about onefourth of the power it uses from other states Since power ngenerated by firms in other states isnt limited by Californias price cap nthose companies generally are in a better position than California firms to nmake a killing on outofmarket sales But by cutting a deal with a ncollaborator in another state energy specialists say California generators nalso can profit handsomely  despite the capnnHeres hownnSay a California generator has 100 megawatts Instead of selling it in nCalifornia where the firm can receive no more than 250 per megawatt hour nunder the current cap it finds a utility an electricity broker or a ncorporate affiliate with an equal amount of power in another state such as nArizona Then  just before an expected heat wave in California which is nlikely to result in an outofmarket call for power here  it convinces the nother firm to do a tradennUnder the deal the California generator sends its 100 megawatts for one hour nto the company in Arizona where there is no price cap and earns 300 or nmore per megawatt  for a total of 300000 In return the Arizona firm nships its 100 megawatts for one hour here Since that power isnt subject to nCalifornias cap it earns perhaps 400 per megawatt  for a total of n400000nnPresumably energy specialists say the two firms then split the 100000 ndifferencennThe potential profit from such deals is considerable Generators in and out nof California received more than 110 million from outofmarket sales this nsummer according to the Independent System Operator But determining if nmegawatt laundering is really happening how often and who might be nbenefiting is difficultnnOne California investigator said authorities first suspected that megawatt nlaundering was occurring when they noticed that precisely the same amount of npower was being sold to another state and then sold back into California nminutes later But other experts said the evidence has rarely been that nclear While hundreds of megawatts is sold into and out of the state on any ngiven day they said the suspicion that firms were conspiring to sell the nsame power back and forth has stemmed largely from unfounded speculationnnOne big problem for investigators trying to learn if the system has been nabused is that confidentiality rules keep many of the details about these nelectricity transactions privatennEntities like us and others who may be suffering from the consequences of nthis laundering dont necessarily have the documents to prove it said Gary nStern director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison one of nthe states three main utilities We can only speculate based on things nweve heard from others about the practiceIts our hope thats one of the nthings thats being examined by the various federal and state agencies ninvestigating this summers extraordinary rise in California power pricesnnIndeed while some people say megawatt laundering can be substantially nlimited by ending the practice of paying more than the wholesale cap for noutofstate power others argue that its just as important to eliminate the nsecrecy surrounding electricity transactionsnnId like to see more information made public said Jim Bushnell a nresearcher at the University of California Energy Institute in Berkeley who nspecializes in analyzing the states energy markets There are a lot of nrumors circulating around this he said of megawatt laundering and it nwould help clarify if this is a serious problemnnnnnnTo see more of the San Jose Mercury News or to subscribe to the newspaper ngo to httpwwwsjmercurycom,1
bThis morning the FERC had its meeting to discuss events in California and  nthe FERCx01s response to them The following is a summary of the remarks of nthe  four Commissioners and the major points of what has been ordered nnMajor featuresnn1 Proposes to replace ISO and PX boards with independent  nonstakeholder nboardsnn2 Continued significant role for the presidents of PXISO who  should be nmade voting membersnn3 Elimination of mandated buysell requirement for the IOUs  although no nexplanation as to whether this requires CPUC action Overreliance  on spot nmarkets has been problematicalnn4 As an independent exchange the PX will be free to design the  products ndesired by the marketnn5 The proposed price modification measure will be a temporary  measure nSingle price for all offers below 150 However no bid above 150 will  set nthe price for all generators A seller can bid anything it wants Allowing  ngenerators to receive their asbid price will allow highcost generators to  nparticipate in the market However the generator will be required to nprovide  confidential reports to FERC explaining the necessity for bids over n150 through  123102nn6 The order requires forward scheduling of 95 of an scheduling  ncoordinatorx01s schedule with a penalty applied for deviations which exceed 5 nAs  an incentive the proceeds of the penalties go to the schedulers who ncomply with  the tolerance bandnn7 Rejects the purchase price caps proposed by the ISO The order  would neliminate the ISOx01s price cap authoritynn8 Beginning 1101 the prospect of refunds will be available  nnCommissioner HebertnnDue to a technical problem when I called in I heard only part of his  nremarks He announced that he will have a separate concurrence in the order nbut  is troubled by some of its features The 150 cap is questionable nwhether  described as a Soft cap or as a hard capnHis concern is that it will  clearly discourage new investment in generation nHe therefore recommended that  the 150 cap should be escalated on a regular nbasis perhaps every six months  until it reaches at least 250 nnHe points out that the ISO and PX are required to make RTO filings to FERC  non 11601 These filings should address the major aspects of the Order nissued  today nnHebert also questioned the issue of refunds alleging that it was  ndisingenuous to suggests that refunds were a possible remedy nnCommissioner Breathitt nnBreathitt announced almost all of the foregoing major points of the  orderThe norder is based on a market approach In choosing our marketbased  approach nit is our goal to guide the markets to selfcorrect and not  reinstitute ncommand and control regulation We have all worked too hard  too long to nhave this resultnnCommissioner MasseynnSixtyfive years ago the Congress decreed that prices had to be just and  nreasonable There is no exception for marketbased approaches He will  nconcur as the order does find that prices have been unjust and nunreasonable  The order does insure that prices should return to being just nand reasonable  Cited Frank Wolak as proposing there ought to be an 1824 nmonth forward product  designed which the CPUC will years ago federal law ndictated that prices had to  be just and reasonablennThe 150 is a soft cap and allows a generator to bid above it but if  it ndoes it will not set the price which other generators receive He invites  ncomments on this issue nnWith regard to retroactive refunds the Office of the General Counsel  has nprepared a legal memorandum which concludes that the FERC probably does not  nhave authority to order refunds retroactively for any date before October 2  n2000 Invites comments on this issue nCalifornia needs new generation and  transmission and the siting authority nbelongs to the state California must do  its part to ensure that customers ndo in fact benefit from competitive markets  that ensure just and nreasonable prices nHe is not yet confident that the  Commission has taken all necessary steps nnChairman HoeckernnHe strongly supports the order nnComments are due in three weeks This is no time to pull punches He  cited nthe San Diego hearings as indicating that California markets were  out of nsynch with the needs of the digital economy For FERC regulators  who are nused to corporate struggles among utilities and other large companies  this nwas a real eyeopener nnAverage citizens had no warning this was going to happen and they had  no ncompetitive alternatives It was unfair to them and there is plenty of  nresponsibility for this meltdown to go around nnIf I was a senior citizen in San Diego living on a fixed income or a  small nbusiness owner living on a small profit margin or a school administrator  ndealing with a tight budget the doubling of my bill would make me want my nmoney  back or to at least ensure that this wonx01t happen again in the nfuturenMany  who expected this order expected a lynching and the transfer of large namounts  of money They want us to round up the bad guys who manipulated the nmarket and  order the disgorgement of their illgotten gains As our legal nopinion  indicates thatx01s not going to happen Todayx01s order offers a nthoughtful  way back to a rational basis for buying and selling power in the nWestnnWe are not ignoring actual or undue discrimination or actual abuses of  nmarket power The order makes better market monitoring going forward a  nfundamental part of FERCx01s proposal If evidence of such behavior is  nbrought forward FERC will act on that information However we canx01t delay  nwork on a market fix while searching for the culpable parties nnHoecker believes that strong federal action is both warranted and  nimportant at this moment The bulk power grid must be made to work  nefficiently across the entire West nnCompetition is at risk make no mistake about that In view of the  nCalifornia experience several states are reconsidering or shelving plans to  nimplement competition Legislators will want to retain the possibility of  nreturning to the old days of verticallyintegrated utilities The  nCalifornia experience has been instructive but not helpfulx01to the nmeandering  implementation of competition throughout the nation nnThe statex01s markets have not been mistakenly federalized as alleged  by nsome The markets are regional Californiax01s access to interstate power  nsupplies is critical as was made evident by recent events If we do things  nright California will not be a federal enclave designed to satisfy our nmarket  predilections it will be a workable and competitive market that nbenefits  consumers nnThis is a strong order It needs to be a strong order We expect to  have a nstrong order in December and the public needs it nnA copy of

bWhile I appreciate the virtue of flying below the radar if possible the nmatter here is complicated by the fact that FERCs discovery rules 18 CFR nSubpart D pertain only to proceedings set for hearing    and to such nproceedings as the Commission may order  18 CFR 385401  In this case nFERC stated that a trialtype hearing is not necessary     and nspecifically rejected the use of a trialtype evidentiary hearing  Slip nop at 4748  n97  Thus while I have not researched the matter as yet my npreliminary view is that the CPUCs attempt to invoke FERCs discovery nprocesses would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERCs Nov 1 order nand its regulations unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case  nThe CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it nspecifically attempts to equate paper hearings with trialtype hearings nsee page 1 of its MotionnnThe CPUCs motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery nin this case under Rule 401  While the CPUCs motion does not apply directly nto marketers FERCs ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or nsomeone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties  As a result we nneed to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to npresent our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing nwith an expedited decisional track particularly in light of the fact that nStaff has already conductednn Jeffrey Watkiss 110800 1031AM nDoes anyone have an idea as to why marketers including EPMI are not nincluded in

bYour assessment makes perfect sense to me  What do you think about having nNels make the call to Lundquist just to find out what his status is what he nmight look for when his current assignment is over etc  obviously without nidentifying us  presumably Nels would have reason to talk to him anyway in nthe normal course of business  I am not wedded to the idea but am inclined ntoward at least getting the information unless you see a problemnnnntLinda Robertsonnt03132001 0216 PMntt ntt To Steven J KeanNAEnronEnron Richard ShapiroNAEnronEnronntt cc ntt Subject Andrew LundquistnnI got your message about Andrew  He would be an excellent catch  However I nsee a couple of significant problems  My guess is that Andrew is too senior nfor this position particularly after having chaired the Cheney task force  nAlso I would not anticipate that he would be available for several months nif then  We should fill this position immediately  We are already missing nopportunities because this position is vacant nnAs for our search using Korn Ferry I have narrowed the field to two very ngood candidates   I am setting up time for Rick to interview these ncandidates next Monday  The first candidate is Drew Maloney with Rep Tom nDelays office  Drew would give us enormous visibility in House Republican nleadership circles seems trustworthy and capable of learning most of the nsubstance of the energy portfolio  Drew has strong networking skills which nI think would nicely fit with Toms strategic and technical skills  The nsecond candidate is John Shelk whom I have known for nearly 15 years  John nwas the lead Republican staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee nunder Norm Lent  John left the Committee in 1992  Since then John has nworked in the financial services and gaming industries where he has enhanced nhis political and Republican networking skills  John in very short order nwould have extremely strong technical skills atlhough he has been away from nthe industry for eight years  I believe both candidates bring different but nvery strong talents to the job  I have a second opening for an enviromental nadvocate  I am discussing with Rick the possibility of whether we could nredirect one of these candidates probably John to that slot   That said nplease let me know if I should have Nels pursue Andrewn,5
