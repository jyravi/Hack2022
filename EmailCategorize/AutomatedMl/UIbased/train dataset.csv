INVESTIGATION IN CA  What should they be looking for  nnHere are some more thoughtsnFERC should take a hard look at why the ISO is almost always in an inc nsituation in real time  Without structural incentives to go short into real ntime I would expect the CAISO to inc in some hours and dec in others  nwith no consistent patternsnThe IOUs have four choices for purchasing power  PX Block Forward PX Day nAhead PX Day Of and CAISO Ex Post  They had ample opportunity to purchase nlower cost power in the PX Block Forward but didnt buy enough  That left nthem short in the Day Ahead  They can reduce Day Ahead prices by moving some nof their load to the Ex Post market  Dave Parquet did an Econ 101 npresentation on this incentive at the CAISO board meeting in JunenThe ISO remains primarily in inc mode even during the shoulder months when nprices are lower another indicator that the real time inc problem is ndriven by the load side rather than the supply side  The IOUs continue to ngo short into the ISO Ex Post market even when the CAISO Ex Post price is nconsistently above the PX Day Ahead pricenThere is evidence that the IOUs are not willing to pay above the CAISO price ncap for energy from the PX in the Day Ahead market  Does it matter that the nprice cap for the ISO also acts as a PX price capnThe NOx market in California is very tight  How has this contributed to nhigher costs and has the complete lack of available NOx credits prevented any ngenerators from runningnHow large was the impact of the below normal water year on the supply side  nThe attached presentation quantifies this effect in the Northwest  I have a ntheory on how hydro capacity completely overstates reserve margins in the nwest from an economic perspective  I can go into more detail if you wishnFriction between California PX and ISO markets and other western markets  nFor example why are actual flows going into the state yet prices out side of nthe state are higher  Another example of anomylous behavior is at COB on n811 and 812  There was congestion from California TO the northwest those ndays in the Day Ahead market  In real time the NW ended up being a net nseller of about 3000 MW from the NW TO CalifornianDemand Side  we really need to press on this issue because all of the nproponents of price caps claim that as soon as the demand side is workably ncompetitive then there is no need for price caps  Is largescale economic ndemand response required for a competitive market  What if demand response nis there but at very high prices  The demand response in California is a njoke  With 2700 MW of interuptible why did the utilities and the CAISO only nget around 600 MW of economic demand response  Much of this response comes nat 1500MWh  The assymetric treatment of supply side resources and demand nside resources can be justified on environmental grounds but not economic ngrounds  So why this assymetric treatment  This gets to the question of the nfine line between scarcity rents which are ok and market power which is nnot  If power is scarce and demand truly values it at 1500MWh then nshouldnt that be the price  At what price would the rest of the ninteruptible load economically curtail  Bottom line  there are about 2000 nMW of load that should be able to respond to price signals that chooses not nto or values power at more than 1500MWhnBurden of proof  what empirical measures should be used to assess market npower  The reports published to date have been unimpressive  The Market nAnalysis Unit report for example does a bunch of handwaving and then nconcludes that there is market power  But they never explain why  I would nthink that proof might be something like this  Generator X sets price y of nthe time when loads exceed Z MWs  Or four generators set price 80 of the ntime when prices exceed 200MWh  They have all the data to be able to tell nyet they dont provide any empirical measures  The only test Ive heard of nso far is the UC Energy Institute report that demonstrates that generators nare submitting bids above their marginal cost  The PX report states that nsupply bids are fewer and at higher prices than last year  They fail to nmention the fact that there are 5000 fewer MW of hydro this year relative to nlastnnnnJames D SteffesEESn08172000 0618 AMnTo Tim BeldenHOUECTECT Jeff DasovichSFOEESEES Mary HainHOUECTECT

bIn my interview I stressed that a big part of the communication problem is nthe narrow and impermanent nature of the information about whats going on at nEnron  Narrow because for every significant activity there are only a few nwho are in the loop and impermanent because very little information is ncommitted to writing most of it is exchanged in person or over the phone  nThis is I believe what lies at the heart of complaints about ncrossdepartment communication  We now have some solutions emerging  nsoftware that enables more people to record and post information in HTML nformat on company intranet sites  I suspect that using such tools will face ntwo obstacles learning how to use them ie theres a huge need for training nand making it part of our culture as a knowledgelearning

preliminary answers to your questions and I have copied GPG nand Government Affairs folks as well to share this information  nn1  I am currently assessing the situation regarding pipeline safety nlegislation  This week has been very quiet on Capitol Hill as all of the nmembers are back in the states on August recess running for reelection and nit is a big vacation week for staffbut heres what I am hearingnnAs you may or may not know we have been been very active this year trying to ntemper pipeline safety legislation that was fairly reactionary in the wake of nlast summers liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham WA   nnSENATE  In June Senators John McCain RAZ and Slade Gorton RWA led the ncharge to pass a pipeline safety bill S 2438 out of the Senate Commerce nCommittee and that bill is awaiting floor action in the Senate   Because of nthe hasty way in which S 2438 was drafted and passed there was a nrealization by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that the bill ncould not make it to the floor for a vote until some serious changes were nmade  mostly things that were deal breakers for industry  Enron and El nPaso were leading the charge and we had a number of Senators backing our nefforts to negotiate changes including Majority Leader Trent Lott RMS nKay Bailey Hutchison RTX John Breaux DLA and Sam Brownback RKS   nFrom what Ive learned since the accident these Senators are not changing ntheir strategy and are still asking for the same improvements  Fortunately nmost of the changes we were looking to make were fairly technical and not the ntypes of things that would be seriously compromised by the accident   nIndusty was already in the position of having to accept a number of things nthey never would have if not for he Bellingham incidentthe El Paso nincident just reinforces those   The biggest potential effect I see from the nEl Paso accident is an increased effort to pass something before the Congress nadjourns in early October  The New Mexico Senators are already calling for a nfloor vote on the McCainGorton legislation and I there will certainly be ngreater pressure on leaders to wrap up negotiations get agreement from all nsides on a bill and move it unanimously through a vote on the Senate floornnHOUSE   The House is moving a bit more slowly but again Id expect the El nPaso situation to expedite things somewhat  There were several bills nintroduced in the House that were not moving anywhere including an identical ncopy of the McCain legislation introduced by Rep Bob Franks RNJ  Franks nis now anxious to move legislation as he is running for Senate and would nlove to take credit for helping out on an issue of national visibility   nBefore the accident House Tranportation Committee leaders on both the nDemocrat and Republican side were working on a consensus bill that they ncould introduce in early September and move quickly through the Committee and nto the House floor   Im told that negotiations on that legislation are nmoving forward and a draft bill will be produced shortly  Unlike our nexperience in the Senate we have had significant input into the bill in nadvance and expect something that we can live with  and something more nreasonable than the McCain bill   With that said there may be an effort to nexpand the bill in a few areas because of the El Paso accident so well have nto see what kind of hand were dealt in the next few weeks  nnOverall Id expect pipeline safety legislation to be given higher priority nwhen Congress returns after Labor Day  In the absence of this accident I nwould have given it slim odds of passing in the few short weeks until nadjournment with appropriations bills taking up most of Congress precious ntime   Now there will be greater pressure to come to consensus and move nbills through by an expedited process so that everyone running for election nin November can show that theyve done something about this terrible ntragedy   With that said theres still not that much time to get nlegislation through so Id say that theres still a chance it may not get ndone this year   If I had to attach a number to it Id say that the El Paso naccident improves the chances of legislation going all the way to probably n5060nn2  Gas supply to California   Ill have to do some more checking in this narea and get back to you   All Ive heard so far is that the safety nquestions that remain may slow the speed of restarting flow on the line nnotwithstanding that El Paso thinks it can have things running again fairly nquickly   Im sure the power crunch in California will put some ncounterpressure on but I just dont have good intelligence on this yetnnWith all this said Im on vacation this week and parts of next week nfinishing up some leave Ive taken for the birth of our new baby daughter so nI may not have an additional report for you until early to mid next weeknnIf you have questions please respond by email or leave a message on my nvoice mail

look at why the ISO is almost always in an inc nsituation in real time  Without structural incentives to go short into real ntime I would expect the CAISO to inc in some hours and dec in others  nwith no consistent patternsnThe IOUs have four choices for purchasing power  PX Block Forward PX Day nAhead PX Day Of and CAISO Ex Post  They had ample opportunity to purchase nlower cost power in the PX Block Forward but didnt buy enough  That left nthem short in the Day Ahead  They can reduce Day Ahead prices by moving some nof their load to the Ex Post market  Dave Parquet did an Econ 101 npresentation on this incentive at the CAISO board meeting in JunenThe ISO remains primarily in inc mode even during the shoulder months when nprices are lower another indicator that the real time inc problem is ndriven by the load side rather than the supply side  The IOUs continue to ngo short into the ISO Ex Post market even when the CAISO Ex Post price is nconsistently above the PX Day Ahead pricenThere is evidence that the IOUs are not willing to pay above the CAISO price ncap for energy from the PX in the Day Ahead market  Does it matter that the nprice cap for the ISO also acts as a PX price capnThe NOx market in California is very tight  How has this contributed to nhigher costs and has the complete lack of available NOx credits prevented any ngenerators from runningnHow large was the impact of the below normal water year on the supply side  nThe attached presentation quantifies this effect in the Northwest  I have a ntheory on how hydro capacity completely overstates reserve margins in the nwest from an economic perspective  I can go into more detail if you wishnFriction between California PX and ISO markets and other western markets  nFor example why are actual flows going into the state yet prices out side of nthe state are higher  Another example of anomylous behavior is at COB on n811 and 812  There was congestion from California TO the northwest those ndays in the Day Ahead market  In real time the NW ended up being a net nseller of about 3000 MW from the NW TO CalifornianDemand Side  we really need to press on this issue because all of the nproponents of price caps claim that as soon as the demand side is workably ncompetitive then there is no need for price caps  Is largescale economic ndemand response required for a competitive market  What if demand response nis there but at very high prices  The demand response in California is a njoke  With 2700 MW of interuptible why did the utilities and the CAISO only nget around 600 MW of economic demand response  Much of this response comes nat 1500MWh  The assymetric treatment of supply side resources and demand nside resources can be justified on environmental grounds but not economic ngrounds  So why this assymetric treatment  This gets to the question of the nfine line between scarcity rents which are ok and market power which is nnot  If power is scarce and demand truly values it at 1500MWh then nshouldnt that be the price  At what price would the rest of the ninteruptible load economically curtail  Bottom line  there are about 2000 nMW of load that should be able to respond to price signals that chooses not nto or values power at more than 1500MWhnBurden of proof  what empirical measures should be used to assess market npower  The reports published to date have been unimpressive  The Market nAnalysis Unit report for example does a bunch of handwaving and then nconcludes that there is market power  But they never explain why  I would nthink that proof might be something like this  Generator X sets price y of nthe time when loads exceed Z MWs  Or four generators set price 80 of the ntime when prices exceed 200MWh  They have all the data to be able to tell nyet they dont provide any empirical measures  The only test Ive heard of nso far is the UC Energy Institute report that demonstrates that generators nare submitting bids above their marginal cost  The PX report states that nsupply bids are fewer and at higher prices than last year  They fail to nmention the fact that there are 5000 fewer MW of hydro this year relative to nlastnnnnJames D

August 25 2000  Return to Headlinesnnn      Publication Date Friday August 25 2000n      Page C1n      Los Angeles Times Home Editionn      Copyright 2000  The Times Mirror Companyn      By JAMES FLANIGANnn   Lets be clear the fact that the state botched the job ofn deregulation to begin with is one reason Californias electricity marketn is such a messnn   But failure to build a single new power plant in the staten even as Californias economy expanded its use of electricity is the basicn cause of todays shortages and soaring prices in San Diego Orange Countyn and other areasnn   Still some simple steps can be taken by regulatorsn legislators and Gov Gray Davis to provide immediate reliefnn   The states major utilities should be free to buy powern wherever they can get it They should not have to buy exclusively from then Power Exchange the Pasadenabased power pool that was set up by the 1998n deregulation to achieve auctionbased prices for roughly 80 of then states electricitynn   Approval should be expedited for adding smaller generatingn plants that supply power at times of peak demand That could alleviate an tight supplydemand situation over the next year or two while largern plants are builtnn   Long term the state needs to speed up the approval processn for building new electricity plants The state also should force utilitiesn to invest in the stillregulated system of power transmission lines whichn now has weaknesses in the San Diego and San Francisco areasnn   Perhaps the most glaring fact about Californias electricityn problem is how few companies have stepped up to supply power to thisn enormous market the nations biggest Only 15 or so suppliers includingn federal agencies the states own utilities municipal companies andn private generating firms supply power to Californias systemnn   By contrast Pennsylvania which has an electricity marketn less than 12 the size of Californias has 130 separate suppliers ofn electricity today reports John Quain chairman of that states Publicn Utility Commissionnn   Its no coincidence that Pennsylvania has seen monthlyn electric bills drop 3 on average since deregulation Its worked outn terrifically Quain saysnn   What did California do wrong It allowed the states majorn utilitiesPacific Gas  Electric Southern California Edison and Sann Diego Gas  Electricto recover 100 of their unrecovered or strandedn costs for nuclear and hydroelectric plants and for past power purchasen schemes mandated by the California legislature to encourage alternativen sources of energynn   Then Californias legislators told the utilities to selln their conventional power plants to private generating companies all ofn which would sell their power to a central Power Exchangenn   The California scheme was flawed at once overregulated andn yet commercially clueless in not foreseeing trouble from a single powern pool fed by only a handful of suppliersnn   How did Pennsylvania do it It allowed the states utilitiesn to recover no more than 67 of their stranded costs for nuclearn plantsreasoning that company shareholders should accept some of the riskn of their investments And rather than set up a central power exchange then state allowed its utilities and newcomers to the states electric systemn to compete for businessnn   Competition after all is what deregulation is supposed ton encourage And competition is not happening in Californiann   It should be noted that the summer is relatively cool in then East this year and extraordinarily hot throughout the West All then Western states are suffering electricity problems Thats another reasonn for Californias troublenn   Normally 28 of Californias electricity comes from USn and Canadian government systems and from utilities in Oregon andn Washington Nevada and Arizona But this year because of lowern hydroelectric supplies and higher demand from booming economies in thosen other states power for California is in shorter supply and more expensiven when the state can get it Now there are accusations that some suppliersn to California have taken advantage of their market leverage to extractn premium prices for powernn   Theres nothing illegal in angling for a better price or inn using futures markets and other trading techniques as some generators mayn have done If any stepped over the line to illegal collusion federal andn other investigations will determine the factsnn   But who gave the generators the market leverage to exploitn us The California regulators legislators and utilities did Told to selln their generating plants in 1998 the utilities sold dozens of plants inn package deals of two and three to single buyers They received premiumn prices from buyers such as AES Corp Duke Energy Southern Co Reliantn Energy Dynegy and NRG The premiums were paid for the market leveragen that multiple plants afforded the buyersnn   Nobody in the utilities reckoned that they were handingn market leverage to potential commercial adversaries Nobody in then Legislature or the regulatory staffs reckoned that the central Powern Exchange could be held up by market leveragenn   As outsiders often say about

As thenstates booming economy taxes the ability to meet electricity demands anfederal investigation is underwaynCHRIS KRAULnTIMES STAFF WRITERnnAug 28 2000nLos Angeles TimesnHome EditionnPage A1nCopyright 2000  The Times Mirror Companynn   With Southern Californians reeling from skyrocketing electric billsncritics charge that fewer than a dozen power suppliers are reaping farngreater profits than are justified by the recent surge in wholesale pricesnof the natural gas they use to create electricitynnnn  Their behavior is a major focus of a formal investigation announcednlast week by federal regulators Among those under scrutiny are powernmerchants including BDukeB BEnergyB BDynegyBnBReliantB BEnergyB CalpinenSouthern Co and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Criticsnsay the companies are earning huge windfalls selling energy to the twonstate agencies charged with distributing power in Californiann   The power merchants themselves deny any profiteering describing theirnmarket moves as legal business practices and welcoming the investigationn   The underlying cause of Californias energy turmoil is a severenshortage of powergenerating capacity to meet the soaring energy demandsnof the states booming economy This summer the state at times has had tonimport more than 20 of its energy needs a shortfall equal to the outputnof about 20 mediumsize power plants No plants of any size have beennbuilt in the state in 10 yearsn   But the problem goes beyond a supplyanddemand imbalance Thensocalled merchant power companies ability to bend the market to theirnadvantageusing what appear to be legal strategiesillustrates whatnmany say are serious flaws in the states deregulated energy marketn   One major flaw is that sellers do not have to participate in thenstates main electricity auctionthe socalled day forward sale heldnone day before electricity is delivered to the states residences andnbusinesses Instead generators are withholding power until the day ofndelivery when desperate state agencies are willing to pay steep pricesnto keep the power flowingn   The upshot has been a doubling of electric bills for the 12 millionncustomers in San Diego GasElectrics coverage area and SouthernnCalifornia Edison and Pacific GasElectric customers may be facingnhigher prices once their rates are unfrozen in 2002n   There is little prospect for shortterm relief with no additionalnpower generation due for a year the prices of natural gas and crude oilnare still rising In fact state officials expect the market to becomentighter over the next year as demand and fuel prices risen   In pointing the finger at the power merchants Gov Gray Davis somenacademics and utility executives charge that California consumers arenbeing victimized by sophisticated trading techniques that take advantagenof the market system to extract huge profitsn   Deregulation only works if people act responsibly It wont work ifnpeople say their only goal is to make as much money as humanly possiblenDavis said last weekn   This brokering takes place on the California Power Exchange and thenIndependent System Operator two agencies created by the 1996 legislationnthat ostensibly opened up 70 of the states power marketrepresented bynthe PGE SCE and SDGE service areasto competition To create thatncompetition lawmakers ordered the utilities to sell power plants tonindependent companies which now are selling electricity to the staten   The Power Exchange is a clearinghouse for the bulk of energy tradingnthat is completed a day in advance of delivery which normally fills mostnof the states energy needs The ISO the nominal traffic cop arrangingndeliveries over the power grid also has the authority to hold samedaynpower auctions for immediate delivery in the event of unexpectedly highndemandn   The Power Exchange is subject to a price cap of 250 pernmegawatthour a ceiling imposed earlier this summer as prices began tonsoar But the ISO has the authority to pay as much as it has to fornsupplementary power if the previousday purchases prove insufficient tonkeep the states lights onn   And it is the secondary ISO market where power suppliers leveraging ansellers market are holding sway By withholding their energy from thenPower Exchange and opting instead to bid their supply to the ISO theynare betting that sameday shortages will generate prices as close to thenprice cap as possible possibly even above itn   Its apparently workingn   On some days the ISO has ended up buying onefifth of the statesnenergy needs not the 5 to 10 maximum originally envisioned In thenprocess desperate to meet demand the ISO is paying premium prices andnthose prices are being passed along to consumersn   The problem with the market apparently defies easy solutions At annemergency meeting Friday to discuss ways of dealing with the crisis thenISO board rejected a staff proposal to force energy merchants to allocatenat least 90 of the electricity they intend to sell in the day forwardnauction held by the Power Exchange instead of holding back until the daynof deliveryn   Although ISO Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure wouldnrestore some market order the board rejected it on fears that it mightncreate unforeseen ramifications possibly even power suppliers abandoningnthe state altogethern   As the market stands now independent power companies have been ablento exploit the power shortages and the markets quirks to charge thenstate higher rates than the increases in the price of natural gas wouldnseem to warrant said Severin Borenstein a UC Berkeley professor andnenergy specialistn   With fellow UC Berkeley professor James Bushnell and Stanfords FranknWolak Borenstein studied the Power Exchange over a 15month period endednin September and found evidence of market power or the powerngenerators ability to raise prices above competitive levels fornsustained periodsn   Unless there is collusion among two or more power providers thenexercise of market power is not illegal experts say But if prolongednit is a symptom of a seriously dysfunctional marketn   I think market power has probably gotten worse this year There arenplayers big enough to move the price and move it a lot Prices arenclearly way above their costs Borenstein saidn   Edison CEO John Bryson and Stephen Baum head of SDGE parent SempranEnergy have similar criticisms Their claims will be investigated by thenFederal Energy Regulatory Commission the latest of five probes underwayninto Californias worsening energy predicament Well see whether therenare alternative market rules that should be adopted to have a betternfunctioning more efficient market said Daniel Larcamp FERCs directornof market tariffs and rates Looking at market power issues is annimportant focus of our investigationn   Power suppliers Duke Energy and Calpine denied any marketnmanipulation saying the bulk of their energy is sold on longtermncontracts and is not used to unduly sway dayahead prices on the PowernExchange or sameday sales on the ISOn   No way are we manipulating the market and we have welcomedninvestigation into our business practices said Tom Williams spokesmannfor Duke Energys California regional office in Morro Bay Its easy tonpoint fingers at someone who controls only 4 of the market much ofnwhich has already been sold in the forward market months agon   Calpine spokesman Bill Highlander said the high prices are simply ancase of demand far outstripping the states ability to meet it Tennyears ago you had more supply than demand Now you have a skyrocketingndemand from population growth a robust economy and Internetfednadditions to demand Highlander saidn   Charles Cicchetti a USC professor of government business and theneconomy agrees and said the market is performing exactly as expectedngiven supply shortages He objects to the limited price ceilings opposednby state officialsn   The choice should be to either regulate the whole thing go back tonwhere we were or let the market work Cicchetti said This hybrid isncausing problems to get worsen   But something appears to be worsening an already bad pricingnsituation and critics believe it is market manipulation In the FERCnorder initiating its investigation the agency noted that Californiasnwholesale electricity costs on June 29 were 340 milliona sevenfoldnincrease over the same date in 1999 Over the same period natural gasnprices only doubledn   FERC will look at other aspects of the states energy deregulation asnwellat the fact that utilities have no choice but to purchase powernfrom the central power exchange and have only limited power to hedge ornmake bilateral deals on their own with outside firmsn   In an interview last week the FERCs Larcamp said his agency isnreserving the right to roll back rates order refunds or even impose annew market framework to replace the Power Exchange and ISOn   Larcamp said the FERCs probe will contrast Californias troublednpower market with the PennsylvaniaMarylandNew Jersey system whichngives end users more freedom to cut their own deals with suppliers Thenresult is that Pennsylvania has more than 130 power suppliers competingnfor the states business versus no more than 15 in Californian   n   Times staff writers Nancy Vogel and Nancy Rivera Brooks contributed tonthis

bIm looking forward to your discussion regarding the reregulation threat at nthe next meeting  Below are some of my observationsnnWhile its premature to say we have an energy crisis we are witnessing the ntriple threat of high summer gasoline prices spiking electricity prices and nhigh natural gas prices for the upcoming heating season Ill send along some nof the datanThere is at least the potential for this to become a prominent national npolitical issue  Gore has focussed relentlessly on Bushs ties to big oil nwhich includes us by the way though we produce nary a drop and nCongressional republicans have blamed the current administration for failing nto have a coherent energy policy though at least so far the dominant ncharacteristic of the administrations policy has been a republicanesque nreliance on the market  nNotwithstanding the issues potential to become political fodder and its nprominence in the popular press many Americans seem blissfully ignorant at nleast on the electricity issue  We did some focus group testing recently in nSouthern California  a mere 15 minutes from the epicenter of the San Diego nprice quakes  and most people knew nothing about it  So while the issue nhas the potential for political traction it may not have caught on yet nexcept in places like San Diego and New York citynThe reaction in California has been to call for government intervention in nelectricity markets  Investigations of out of state price gougers and nprofiteers have been undertaken and wholesale and retail price caps have nbeen put in place  They have not worked  at least in wholesale markets  nSuppliers are deciding to site plants elsewhere and when prices are high nelsewhere in the West power flows out of California to those other markets  nIronically though I cant explain it in classical economic terms the nsetting of rate caps in wholesale markets has had the effect of pulling nprices up to the capped levels in offpeak times when there is more than nenough supply  For the most part though the caps and the other political nreactions have been somewhat muted policy makers have been reluctant to nthrow the deregulation plan out and start over and the retail price caps nhave been relatively narrow  so farnOutside of California the authors of other states deregulation plans have ndistinguished their proposals from Californias  Regulators and legislators nfrom such diverse places as Connecticut Texas and Alberta have gone out of ntheir way to defend their plans and explain why California wont happen nhere  For the most part then the reaction to California has been positive nfrom Enrons perspective in states that have already deregulated  There does nremain some threat that aspects of the state plans eg utility plant ndivestiture may be postponed or cancelled  The story is a bit more grim in nstates that were considering deregulation but have not gone forward with ntheir plans  I think its off the agenda in most places  The fact that most nof the major markets about 70 of total electric revenue are already nderegulatedderegulating is a blessing in that regardnAt the federal level there has been a combination of the burn the village in norder to save it approach   allow some price caps to remove the pressure nto reverse the whole deregulation program  and a more positive call for ncomprehensive reformnAll in all I believe were OK so far and we need to look at this as an nopportunity  business is booming  we sell protection from price volatility nand the need for such protection is now plastered over the front pages of nmajor newspapers  On the public policy front we need to convert the ncontroversy into productive action  Our target has been FERC  they are nsomewhat removed from the white hot rhetoric in California and they are a nsingle commissioners vote away from taking action to further open the nmarketnEnrons response  Initially we hoped to feed information into industry ngroups and let them carry the message our concern was that Enron  a ncompany which was in and out of the residential market in Cal  would not nmake the most attractive champion for the open market message  We hoped that nthe new generators in Cal would take up the mantle  Its fair to say that nthey fumbled the ball  they are now locked in a pitched battle with the nutilities over price caps and fall all to easily into the out of state nprofiteer label  standing between Aunt Millie and rate relief  They were nalso extremely slow out of the blocks with a more productive message  We are nnow working the issue directly  We are working the issue on a number of nlevels 1 PR  we have good contacts in the press and have talked to nnumerous reporters and editorial writers  As time goes on the information nand reporting has gotten somewhat better  2  Govt relations  we have been npushing for power plant siting legislation in California the market wants to nbuild capacity but the government wont let it  This may be the best nenvironment well ever see for streamlining the permitting process  Also in ntypical Enron fashion we put a deal on the table  We offered to sell power nto the local utility at a price which would enable them to lock in stable nrates for their customers at below current rates  Our offer was followed by nnine others and we tried to make something of the fact that the market was noffering better solutions than California politicians  SDGE dropped the nball unfortunately  Instead of seizing the opportunity they ended up going nalong with a government granted rate discount which will cause them to accrue na massive deferral account  At the federal level we are contacting members nthe DOE and FERC  Here we are making a push for FERC action to finish nleveling the playing field in wholesale markets so power can get from where nit is to where its needed  Additionally we are developing a prepackaged nsystem including software for nondiscriminatory open access to take away nany lingering excuses or delays  3 Overall messaging  we have been nworking with a well known political pollster to check our messages for their nresonance at the grassroots level  As we hone these messages we will be nusing them in the fora we are currently workingnOverall we have more opportunity than risk in the current environment but ncapitalizing on those opportunities continues to be a long shotnAn intersting rhetorical challenge for us is this  much of the problem in npower markets is blamed on high upstream fuel prices particularly natural ngas  The gas market is open and structured pretty much the way we are nadvocating for electricity so how can we maintain that the problem in power nmarkets is an absence of open markets when the most open commodity market on nthe planet natural gas is producing such outsized prices  The answer is nsomewhat complicated and therefore a bit unsatisfactory in the current ndebate  gas prices are still lower in real terms than they were nprederegulation  long term prices are also lower than historical levels  nthe curve is backwardated sp meaning that prices in later years are nlower than today so you can buy gas for 3 years at a price lower than current nspot prices and the economy is booming and driving up demand for basic ninputs this begs the question why didnt the market react sooner and avoid nthe spike  When all else fails a big part of the problem can be blamed on nOPEC  We havent had this thrown at us yet but we are trying to anticipate nit and have answers at the readynn This is just the tip of the iceberg  The issue is a great example of the nintersection of our business interests with public policy debates and should npromote a lively discussion when we get together  Let me know if there is nanything else you need,1

Monday and state power officials urged electricity nconservation because todayn  and Wednesday could be even worsenn  Power was cut to hundreds of large business customers and about 125000 nresidential andn  business airconditioner and agricultural pumping customers Monday after nthe Californian  Independent System Operator which runs the electricity grid for about 75 nof the staten  declared a Stage 2 power emergency At Stage 2 when the grid is using more nthan 95 ofn  available power the states big investorowned utilities are asked to ninterrupt power ton  customers that have agreed to this voluntary action in exchange for ndiscounted ratesnn  Grid reliability was threatened when two electricity units in Northern nCalifornia stoppedn  working for a time as heavy airconditioner demand began to push power use nhighern  CalISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle saidnn  Demand peaked at about 42000 megawatts on the CalISO grid but the two nunidentifiedn  units representing about 320 megawatts of generation were returned to nservice in then  afternoonin time to help keep the state from reaching its first Stage 3 nwhich would lead ton  neighborhood blackoutsnn  We were right on the edge of warning about a possible Stage 3 McCorkle nsaid A couplen  of generators fell offline in late morning and that kind of gave everybody na scarenn  A Stage 3 emergency would be declared if power reserves fall below 15in nessencen  when the electricity grid is using more than 985 of available powerand nrotating outagesn  of nonessential customers for an hour or longer would become likely to keep nthe grid fromn  failing That would result in widespread blackouts lasting several hoursnn  Electricity use was also high in the area served by the Los Angeles nDepartment of Watern  and Power peaking near 4750 megawatts Monday But DWP customers were notn  threatened by power interruptions or rolling blackouts because the nmunicipal utility hasn  more than enough generating capacity to meet demandnn  Were doing OK as we have all summer long said DWP General Manager S nDavidn  Freemannn  CalISO asked Southern California Edison Pacific Gas

JournalnA38nCopyright c 2000 Dow Jones  Company IncnnSometime in the next few months the board of General Electric will anoint a nsuccessor to the worlds mostncelebrated corporate leader Running GE may be as Jack Welch claims the nbest job in the world but hisnsuccessor may find it to be one of the toughest as well  not because nanything is going wrong at GE but becausenso much is going right and has been for so long nnMr Welchs successor will inherit a company that is already stupendously nvaluable that has already shed most ofnits unwanted pounds and has already set a string of performance records How ndo you do better than thatnnThis is more than a rhetorical question for GEs next chairman Pity for a nmoment a few other heirs to greatnessnDoug Ivester was gone just 25 months after following the legendary Roberto nGoizueta at CocaCola Dale Morrisonnlasted less than four years at Campbell Soup after taking over from ncostcutter extraordinaire David Johnson BritishnAirways Bob Ayling got pushed out after he had struggled unsuccessfully to nfill the shoes of Colin Marshall AndnDurk Jager prematurely stepped down as Procter  Gambles chairman after nfailing to live up to the lofty standardsnset by earlier PG leaders nnPretenders nnNone of the pretenders succeeded in building greatness on top of greatness nIn three of these cases the boardnbrought back a recently retired CEO or chairman to shore up investor nconfidence Sadly Goizueta who died innOctober 1997 could not reprise his earlier success at CocaCola nnGEs next chairman will have to exceed Mr Welchs nearmythic naccomplishments if GE is to continue to fly highnLike Cisco Intel WalMart Nokia and any other company that is exploring nthe outer atmosphere GE must strugglenever harder to resist the laws that threaten to flatten the arc of success nthe law of large numbers the law ofndiminishing returns and the law of averages nn The law of large numbers Over the past decade GEs market value has nmultiplied elevenfold  to more than 560nbillion from 50 billion at the end of 1990 Sustaining such a breathtaking npace of value growth gets progressivelynharder as a company gets bigger As the most valuable company on the planet nGE would need to grow its marketncap to nearly 3 trillion over the next five years to match the 42 ncompounded annual growth rate it has achievednover the past halfdecade nnOne way of escaping the law of large numbers is to divide big things into nsmall things One option for GE would bento spin out its lowgrowth businesses as separate companies Over the past nfive years profits in two sectors nappliances and plastics  were essentially flat Holding these businesses nmay generate a positive return onninvested capital but no investor would keep them inside a growth portfolio nWhy should GE nnIf GEs next chairman cant muster the courage to leave the dawdlers behind nperhaps he  or she  should spin outnthe stars Of the eight large business segments for which GE reports results ntwo  GE Capital and NBC  accountnfor nearly 50 of GEs fiveyear profit growth Sure GE Capital has nbenefited from its parents dirtcheap cost ofncapital but from an investors point of view these advantages may be more nthan offset by the drag of laggardlynearnings growth in other GE businesses Looking beyond capital and nbroadcasting there are probably a dozennother highgrowth candidates for spinouts in GEs other sectors nnMr Welchs successor shouldnt be afraid to disassemble GE After all the ngoal is not to make GE the worldsnmost valuable company but to make its shareholders the worlds most richly nrewarded Shareholders dont carenwhether GEs stock appreciates or whether its the stock of companies that GE nhas disgorged Breaking up is hardnto do But Mr Welchs successor may find that turning GE into the worlds nfirst 3 trillion company is even harder nn The law of diminishing returns Even the most successful strategies lose ntheir potency over time For most of MrnWelchs tenure GEs strategies of choice have been cost cutting and nacquisitions From its unflinching approach tondownsizing in the mid1980s to its more recent dedication to ebusiness Mr nWelchs GE has been imaginativenand unrelenting in excising waste At the same time GEs top line has been nbuoyed up by a tidal wave ofnacquisitions  more than 300 in the past three years many outside the US nnThe payoff to all this cutting and deal making has been steadily accelerating nearnings growth Net earnings grewn108 in 1996 127 in 1997 133 in 1998 and 153 in 1999 Looking nforward power dieting and binge buyingnmay not be enough to keep GEs earnings escalator rising ever skyward nnThere are already signs that GE may be nearing the asymptotic end of the nefficiency curve Between 1981 andn1990 GEs revenue per employee increased by 187 Yet over the last decade nrevenue per employee grew by anmore modest 55 and has been essentially flat since 1996 And while noperating margins in GEs manufacturingnbusinesses have been steadily improving GEs net profit margin after all nadjustments has remained pretty muchnunchanged over the past five years nnWhat about acquisitions While industry consolidation still has a way to run nparticularly outside the US it seemsninevitable that it will become harder and harder for GE to find underpriced nundermanaged fixeruppers After all atnthe current furious pace of corporate coupling the US would be left with a nsingle company by 2010 nnThat leaves e Ecommerce will drive new efficiencies into GEs business nprocesses but GE is not alone innstriving to eenable its businesses Ecommerce is rapidly becoming an ninformation technology arms race  withncompetitors making titfortat investments to reap titfortat efficiency ngains And while efficiencybesotted CEOs arencounting on the Internet to shrink procurement costs savvy customers will be njust as creative in using the Net tonbeat down prices Whether GEs enthusiasm for all things e produces nlonglasting peerbeating profit growthnremains to be seen nnGEs next chairman may want to borrow a lesson or two from Enron which has nbeen voted Americas mostninnovative company five years running and displaced GE as the best managed ncompany in Fortune magazinesnlast most admired survey Forty percent of Enrons 63 billion market value ncomes from businesses the companynwasnt even in three years ago  all of them are homegrown nnForget acquisitions With GEs powerful brand global reach and fearsome ncapacity for execution theres no reasonnGE shouldnt surpass Enron as a businessbuilding champ It is entirely nreasonable to expect that GE could createn10 to 20 new businesses over the next few years  with each adding an naverage of 5 billion to GEs market value nnSooner or later GE is going to need an entirely new genre of wealthcreating nstrategies  and a much morenaggressive commitment to internally generated new business development may nwell be the most promisingncandidate nn The law of averages Over the past five years GEs priceearnings ratio nhas tripled from just over 16 to more thann48 The company is currently selling at a 65 premium to the market average nPE But being a standout performernfor more than a few years at a time is a daunting challenge for any company nlarge or small It seems that noncompany can forever escape the steady tug of mediocrity nnAt the end of 1999 the Standard  Poors 500 included 326 companies that had nbeen in the index for the entirendecade Fiftyfive of these companies among them GE managed to deliver top nquartile shareholder returns in asnmany as four years out of the previous 10 GEs top quartile results came in n1996 1997 1998 and 1999 If GEsnnew chairman manages to extend this streak for another four years GE will nset a new world record for none of then326 SP veterans achieved top quartile returns in as many as eight years out nof 10 during the 90s and only fourncompanies  Oracle Home Depot Intel and Cisco  cleared the bar seven nyears out of 10 nnIf GE can fire up the entrepreneurial spirit in each of its employees it njust might beat the odds Like most largencompanies GE seems to be reluctant to encourage employees to start new nbusinesses by giving them equitynstakes in new ventures While this isnt the only way to build businesses nits one that cant be ignored in a worldnwhere talented employees are often lured away by the promise of a big chunk nof equity in a startup GE alreadyninvests in startups via GE Equity  to the tune of 15 billion in 1999 nLast year GE also repurchased 19 billion ofnits own stock One wonders just what kind of new wealth GEs own employees nmight have been able to create ifnthey had been backed by this kind of capital nnTo have any hope of escaping Mr Welchs shadow and matching his success nGEs next chairman will have tonkeep a simple truth in mind If youre trying to achieve unprecedented ends nyoure going to need unprecedentednmeans A breakup a few major spinouts a bottomtotop initiative focused non making GE as good at creating boldnnew businesses as it is at improving existing businesses an absolute ncommitment to doubling or tripling GEsninternal growth rate  these are all potential candidates for the next big nthing at GE nnMaybe just maybe GE will continue to fly high with its current success nrecipes One could argue that as long asnthere are companies around the world that arent as wellmanaged as GE Mr nWelchs magnificent buyandimprovenengine will have plenty of fuel Or that GEs Websmitten executives will ndiscover Net advantages no one else hasnyet dreamed of nnAfter 20 years under Mr Welch GE is habituated to meeting new challenges nMoreover GE has a long history ofnorganizational and managerial innovation  it was among the first to ndecentralize along business unit lines embracendisciplined strategic planning delayer its hierarchical organization and ncommit itself to becoming Webified fromnstem to stern Like the Internet GE is diverse global flat meritocratic nand nonhierarchical nnMaybe all of this will help GE to become one of the first companies to marry nthe rulebusting businessbuildingnethos of the new economy with the old economy virtues of scale nefficiency and quality If GE succeeds therenwill be no more talk of new economy and old economy for GE will have managed nto create a perfect synthesis ofnold and new And the most perfectly developed specimen of the industrial age nwill have become the archetype fornthe postindustrial corporation  a company that

indexnlooks like a sea of tranquility nnSince Jan 1 it has gone almost exactly nowhere starting the year at n146925 and closing Friday at 146581nnBut beneath the quiet surface a furious battle is raging among the SPs ncomponents with some of last yearsnlosers becoming this years winners nnSome of the most amazing performers are the naturalgas companies which are nup about 70 as a group so

KeySpan Energy is up almost 60 nOn top of its stock gain KeySpannoffers something some investors arent familiar with a 5 dividend nnNow the big question is should investors be plowing their money into

nnHigher oil prices helped send utility stocks up on Friday and most other nstocks down The Dow Jones IndustrialnAverage fell 145 or 16047 points to 1092700 leaving the bluechip nindex down 262 or

is ndown 24 from its March 10 high nnWithin the SP 500 though there have been some dramatic moves Utilities nare up an astounding 40 just in thentime since the SP peaked on March 24 according to Ned Davis Research nFinancials and drug stocks are upnabout 16 each  again since the SP hit a record nnCommunications stocks on the other hand have fallen 25 in that period The nSP 500s big tech stocks arendown more than 19 nnSome analysts think the move that is under way is broader than a sector nrotation Some of the leastwanted stocksnof 1999 have become desirable this year As huge stocks such as Qualcomm and nYahoo have sagged smallernonceneglected SP companies such as Reebok and Allied Waste have soared nnThe switch can be seen in an index called the Value Line Arithmetic Index nThat index tracks about 1700ncompanies and doesnt give any extra weight to the ones with a larger market nvalue It is a closer reflection of thenaverage company rather than the biggest companies nnSo far this year it is up 13 eclipsing the SP 500 The SP 500 is nweighted according to its members marketnvalue which means that it is dominated by the larger stocks The Value Line nindexs strength compared with thenSP 500 is a clear indication that some of the smaller stocks are making a ncomeback at least for now nnSome of the gains do seem to reflect special circumstances Utilities have nbeen helped by an explosion innnaturalgas prices and by a search for stable investments in a turbulent nstock market Many banks and brokeragenfirms have benefited from takeover speculation Merrill Lynch is up 66 so nfar this year Lehman Brothers is upn69 nnIf takeover expectations fade the brokerage stocks risk a slide And energy ncompanies depend on oil and gasnprices which can make them volatile Naturalgas bulls note however that nnaturalgas prices are expected tonremain high for some time which could keep propelling that group ahead nnVery few people thought energy prices would remain this high for as long as nthey have notes Donaldson Lufkin nJenrette investment strategist Thomas Galvin So you still have people nunderweighted both areas energy andnutilities nnThat means that there still are plenty of skeptics out there If gas prices nstay high the stocks have room to rise asnskeptics are won over nnBut the real trick during the coming months may not be to be in the right nsector but to be in the right stock bothnmen say nnAt a time when the economy is slowing and earnings growth will be more ndifficult you probably want higherqualitynstocks because they have more stable earnings Mr Bernstein says nnWhen tech stocks or utility stocks are in favor it is enough to buy a stock nfrom the group and your stock will go upnNow investors need to be more selective nnEl Paso and Duke Energy are extremely well managed says Mr Galvin as is nEnron But the rising tide innutilities has lifted all boats and not all utilities are well enough managed nto take advantage of all opportunities nnThe key is choosing the stocks that will withstand the more difficult times nto come and that wont be easy Peoplenwho bought Intel or Oracle at the start of this year probably feel as if it nwasnt that bad a year for tech Both despitena recent sag still are up almost 40 this year Those who chose Microsoft or nDell however took a bath Microsoftnis down 45 since the year began and Dell is down almost 30 nnMr Galvin thinks tech stocks will stage a fourthquarter rally as investors nlook for companies that can continue tonbuild profits in a slowing economy He points out that analysts expect tech nto post 38 earnings growth next yearnonly a bit less than this years 41 But benefiting from any rally would nrequire picking the stocks that will have thengood earnings nnAnother way of looking at the uncertain future says Bob Bissell president nof Wells Capital Management is thatnthere could be some unexpected events Companies whose stock prices have nfallen could be acquired or forced tonrestructure which could provide a payoff for investors nnI am thinking of companies like ATT he says Something has got to give nthere The stock is down to the lown30s 47 down from its 52week high

nconference this week in Americas selfproclaimed oil capital Between the nwhispers in the hallways and the bullish presentations from an overflowing nbarrel of oil gas and power companies you might think you were in the ncorridors of some Silicon Valley conference of yesteryear nBut no this is all about energy and energy is hot With oil hanging around n37 per barrel and natural gas solidly above 5 per million BTU oil gas and npower stocks have caught fire To illustrate take a look at the chart of the nPhiladelphia Stock Exchange Oil Service Sector Index or OSX nnUp and to the right And a great deal of the price gain is rational As the nprice of the commodities increases profits follow That should mean positive nearnings from a plethora of oil and gas companies nWhile new Securities and Exchange Commission regulations have stifled the nmore explicit now illicit preannouncements at conferences like this nregulations cant cap all the enthusiasm from rising commodity prices For nexample Kenneth Lay chairman of energy powerhouse Enron ENENYSE said at nthe conference he is very comfortable with analysts estimates hinting the nnumbers are conservative We should meet or exceed analysts expectations nfor the quarter and the year nOthers followed suit Bradley Fischer president of CMS Energy Oil and Gas nCMSNYSE profiled here earlier  said his company will post record nproduction and record income this year because the fundamentals of the oil nand gas business are as good as they have been in his career Ive been in nthis business 28 years The first 10 were good and the last 18 have been ndifficult Now Im looking for the good times to roll nAnd this from Diana Naylor senior vice president at independent power nproducer Calpine CPNNYSE when reacting to analysts estimates in the ncoming year We look to be making that number and look to increase that nguidance on earnings shortly nEven the oil drillers and equipment companies are celebrating Nabors nIndustries NBRAMEX owner of the largest landdrilling fleet thinks nanalysts are significantly underestimating its potential Dain Rauscher nestimates Nabors will earn 83 cents per share this year and 165 next year n numbers Chairman and CEO Eugene Isenberg called conservative He presented ncalculations suggesting the company could earn 327 in the middle of the oil ncycle and has the ability to earn 681 in the coming years The probability nof this happening is very high he said nAll because of 37 per barrel oil and 5 gas While there is little question nthat third and fourthquarter earnings should be strong there is growing nconcern that the oil and gas stock rally has been overdone Not only have nstocks tracked the rise in commodity prices but the oncebeleaguered sector nhas also seen earnings multiples expand significantly nThat is a warning sign to at least one analyst While the going is good the nrapid price rise isnt sustainable Oil stocks stocks will peak in the next nseveral weeks and trade sideways probably for the rest of the year said nJim Wicklund head of energy research at Dain Rauscher adding that there may nbe added selling pressure as funds try to lock in gains before the end of the nyear Stock price pressure will also be impacted by portfolio managers nbonus structure nAnd Wicklund warned that what he sees as the inevitable moderation in oil nprices will put pressure on the stocks into the new year Right or wrong nstock prices are slaves to commodity prices nIf Wicklund is correct the next move could be down and to the left nThe Peoples CourtnOne of the clever and unique features of the Dain Rauscher Wessels energy nconference is the annual investor poll This year nearly 400 investors nresponded to the onsite survey and while the results arent scientific nthey

Conservation n  By KIRK JOHNSON n    n  09262000 n  The New York Times n  Page 1 Column 2 n  c 2000 New York Times Company nn  New Yorkers heard a lot this summer about why their electricity bills were ngoing up andn  why a new generation of power plants was needed and the message centered non onen  word demandnn  Millions of new airconditioners computers and other gadgets are humming nblinking andn  draining electricity from the power pool utility executives and state nenergy officials saidn  over and over again The 40 percent jump in electricity rates that many in nthe region weren  assessed in August was only a hint of what could lie ahead those officials nsuggested ifn  residents did not accept more power plants in their neighborhoodsnn  What the public was not told was that the people framing the argument for nbuilding powern  plants have an abiding interest in selling more electricity Nor was the npublic told that then  means already existed to dampen demand and reduce the amount of new power nneeded ifn  the political will could be exertednn  Before New Yorks energy markets were deregulated beginning in 1998 the nstate requiredn  companies like Consolidated Edison to reduce demand in the system  nthrough energyn  efficiency measures for example  if that choice was cheaper than nbuilding a new plantnn  Under deregulation  that requirement has been lost In an open market nevery participantn  wants to sell more energy and the government agencies in New York and othern  deregulated states that once compelled companies to think of alternatives nhave becomen  silent or powerlessnn  The reliability problems and price spikes in the last two years have led nto a simplistic setn  of solutions build more power plants said Richard Cowart director of nthe Regulatoryn  Assistance Project a nonprofit energy policy institute in Montpelier Vt nthat works withn  state regulators and utilitiesnn  On the new playing field Mr Cowart and other experts said the incentives nare alln  onesidednn  Power generating companies have no motive to encourage people to use less nenergy or ton  use it more efficiently because the most money is to be made when demand is nat its peakn  And electricity delivery companies make more money by sending more nelectricity throughn  their wires The incentive to sell more electricity is overwhelming nMr Cowart saidnn  Certainly demand for electricity is rising in New York and across the ncountry and mostn  experts agree that some added generating capacity is needed And New York nStates topn  electricity official Maureen O Helmer chairwoman of the Public Service nCommission hasn  emphasized in her recent speeches that conservation and efficiency measures nmust ben  part of the solution to rising demandnn  The problem environmental groups and energy analysts say is that in an narena in whichn  government has taken a step back through deregulation  it is harder for nregulators ton  make those opinions countnn  Given the tone of the debate in New York and the sharp jump in prices this nsummer itn  would be easy for the public to think that the regions energy situation is nworse than itn  actually is Most longterm projections for the region say that demand will nincrease less inn  New York State and New York City than in the nation as a whole during the nnext 10 to 15n  years New York it turns out is not an energy hognn  The most recent official longterm projection for New York called the nState Energy Plann  issued in late 1998 said the state could get by with only a very modest nexpansion inn  generating capacity for the next 10 years or no expansion at all if the nlevels of electricityn  that utilities are required to hold in reserve could be modifiednn  The rate of growth in demand is also slowing down not accelerating Within nthe territoryn  served by Consolidated Edison which includes all of New York City and its nnorthernn  suburbs peak demand the highest single moment of energy use on the nheaviest day of then  year rose by 17 percent a year from the mid1990s to the end of the ndecade In the newn  century that growth rate is expected to be 12 percent a yearnn  It will be more modest one senior Con Ed official saidnn  The main implication of those projections economists and energy analysts nsay is thatn  most of the increased capacity proposed for New York City may not be needed nat all atn  least to meet new demand In the Con Ed service area meeting a 12 percent ngrowth inn  demand through new supply alone would require an increased capacity of 500 nto 750n  megawatts over the next five years Developers and power plant builders nhave proposed an  total increase six to eight times greater than that in the next three years nalonenn  No one plant can make the argument that its really needed said Ashok nGupta an energyn  economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council a private conservation ngroup Liken  malls power plants are now being built for market sharenn  Predicting energy demand is notoriously difficult In the early 1970s for nexample then  accepted wisdom was that energy use would continue to grow at the rapid npace that it hadn  in the 1960s Academics and utility industry officials said the country nmight need 1000n  nuclear plants by the turn of the centurynn  But the oil shocks of the mid1970s and early 1980s forced the nintroduction ofn  energyefficiency measures that made those forecasts worthless Energy use nas an  percentage of the nations economy called energy intensity began ndeclining and has donen  so ever sincenn  Some energy officials have said the problem of rising prices and the noverwhelming focus onn  supply is the result of a stillnew electricity market that is not yet nfunctioning as intendednn  Theorists who had envisioned competition as the door to a golden age of nconsumer choicen  had predicted that companies specializing in demand reduction  they sell nways to cutn  energy use through technology or better management  would compete with ncompaniesn  selling supply But that has not happened yet Part of Con Eds prediction nof more modestn  growth in demand in coming years is based on the expectation that ndemandmanagementn  companies will emerge within the next few years company officials saidnn  But state regulatory officials also made the political decision in the late n1990s to reducen  spending for conservation and efficiency measures The state which once nled the region inn  financing for alternatives to new supply  an effort that included ntelevision commercialsn  urging people to think about saving energy  now spends about a third as nmuch per capitan  as most states in the Northeast including Connecticut and New Jersey naccording ton  figures from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authoritynn  Last month a report filed with the State Public Service Commission nrecommended ann  increase in financing for the efficiency program The report was produced nby representativesn  of the electricity industry working alongside consumer and environmental ngroups But then  states utilities including New York State Electric and Gas Niagara nMohawk and Con Edn  refused to support the final report because they were unhappy with its nconclusionsnn   Deregulation undermined the role of utilities in promoting energy nefficiency said Edwardn  A Smeloff the executive director of the Pace Law School Energy Project a nresearch andn  advocacy group that helped write the report As electricity companies have nbecome moren  conscious of the bottom line under deregulation  Mr Smeloff said ndemandreductionn  programs have become a threat to profitsnn  For utilities that buy most of their power from other companies moving nmore electricityn  through the wires has become the primary way to increase profits Mr nSmeloff said Thatsn  the business he addednn  Utility officials say that much of their demand problems come down to one nhour each yearn  that moment of peak demand when consumers are using the most electricity nTo a greatn  degree planning revolves around the need to have adequate supply for that ncrucial momentn  so as to avoid blackouts But experts like Mr Smeloff say the tools nalready exist ton  dampen those peaks and reduce prices to consumers as well if only a nconstituencyn  existed to push for the changesnn  Many business and residential energy uses are routine and could be npostponed for a fewn  hours to dampen load on peak days a plan that efficiency experts say would nbe particularlyn  easy in New York City commercial buildings where energy use is centrally ncontrolled andn  monitored In England one electricity provider created lower rates for nconsumers who rann  appliances like washing machines and dishwashers in offpeak hours The nprogram becamen  so popular that power use in the middle of the night went up significantly nduring then  discountpricing windownn  Environmentalists also worry that increasing power capacity beyond the real ndemand inn  New York could create a kind of selffueling spiral If too many new plants nare built theyn  say prices will probably fall encouraging people to use more electricity nwhile at the samen  time reducing incentives to save energy or use more efficient productsnn  In New York and elsewhere in the country much of the growth in demand is nbeing driven byn  the spread of airconditioning especially from people buying extra units nto cool more partsn  of their homes Last year Con Ed began a kind of visual history project in nwhich employeesn  began regularly photographing 90 apartment buildings in New York City and ncounting then  number of window airconditioners In one year the total went up by 5 npercentnn  Some energy experts say more airconditioning could further increase the nspurts in demandn  that could in turn lead to more power plants which many scientists say are nprime sourcesn  of the greenhouse gases blamed for global warmingnn  We have hotter summers because of greenhouse gases and more greenhouse ngasesn  because of more airconditioning said Joseph Romm the executive ndirector of the Centern  for Energy and Climate Solutions a nonprofit consulting institute based in nVirginia It wouldn  certainly be ironic if people decided that the solution was more power nplants nn  Chart LEDGER Efficiency Plans While

Amnesty said the police involved in suppressing protests includednthe Special Reserve Police SRP on the site of the company Itnadded The involvement of the SRP in the harassment of protestersnindicates the need for the three US multinationals participatingnin the joint venture to take steps to ensure that all the managementnand staff of the DPC Dabhol Power Companyin particular anynsecurity staff subcontracted to seconded to or employed by thencompanyare trained in human rights and are fully accountable forntheir actionsnn  A January 1999 investigation by Human Rights Watch came to anstronger conclusion Human Rights Watch believes that the DabholnPower Corporation and its parent company Enron are complicit innthese human rights violations it said The company undernprovisions of law paid the abusive state forces for the securitynthey provided to the company These forces located adjacent to thenproject site were only stationed there to deal with protests Innaddition contractors for DPC engaged in a pattern of harassmentnintimidation and attacks on individuals opposed to the Dabhol Powernproject    The Dabhol Power Corporation refused to acknowledgenthat its contractors were responsible for criminal acts and did notnadequately investigate condemn or cease relationships with thesenindividualsnn  Enron denies any wrongdoing While we respect the mission of HumannRights Watch we do not feel that its report on the Dabhol Powernproject is accurate says an Enron spokesperson The report refersnto peaceful protests when in fact the reason the police werenpositioned near our site is that there have been many acts ofnviolence against our employees and contractors Dabhol Power Companynhas worked hard to promote positive relations with the communitynUnfortunately the good relationship we have built with a largenpercentage of the community was not reflected in the report Enronnis committed to providing energy and communications services whilenpreserving the human rights of citizens and our workersnn  Enron has also raised a stink in Bolivia with its involvement innthe Cuiaba Integrated Energy Project The project is run bynTransredes Bolivias hydrocarbon transport company which came intonbeing in 1997 after Bolivia privatized its oil sector under theninfluence of the World Bank A joint venture of Enron and Shell ownsn50 percent of Transredes On January 31 2000 a Transredes oilnpipeline erupted and dumped an estimated 10000 barrels of refinedncrude oil and gasoline into the Desaguadero River which supportsnindigenous communities such as the Uru Muratosnn  This problem is Transredess number one priority and we arencommitted to continue to work hard to mitigate the short andnlongterm social and environmental impact wrote Steve Hoppernpresident of Transredes in a letter addressed To the People ofnBolivia on February 7nn  Facing starvation from the Loss of their lifesustaining waterfowlnand fish the Uru Muratos left their ancestral lands at the southernnshores of Lake Poopo in April and marched eightyfive miles to thencity of Oruro to ask for government helpnn  We subsequently reached an agreement with them to provide certainnlevels of relief and assistance says Keith Miceli general managernfor public relations for Enron South Americann  In its actions overseas Enron has made a practice of takingnadvantage of corporate welfare And it has enlisted George W Bush innthis effortnn  For example in March 1997 Lay wrote a letter to Bush that wasnsubsequently released to the press under Texas open records lawsnasking him to contact every member of the Texas delegation innCongress to explain how export credit agencies of the United Statesnare critical to US developers like Enron who are pursuingninternational projects in developing countries These agenciesninclude the Overseas Private Investment Corporation OPIC whichnprovides political risk coverage and financial support to USncompanies investing abroadnn  OPIC provided financing or insurance coverage worth almost 300nmillion for Enrons foreign projects just last year according tongovernment records The New York Times reported Enron officialsnhave in the past asked Mr Bush to help lobby lawmakers tonappropriate funds of OPIC as well as for the ExportImport Banknanother federal agency that aids American companies abroadnn  Enron received 200 million in political risk insurance for thenDabhol project in 1996 And it received 200 million in insurancenfrom OPIC in 1999 for its Bolivian projectnn  The Enron Methanol plant in Pasadena Texas lies in the HoustonnShip Channel area the nations largest concentration ofnpetrochemical plants just east of the city The plant has wonnspecial concessions from Governor Bush allowing the company tonpollute without a permit as well as giving it immunity fromnprosecution for violating some environmental standardsnn  Plants like this in Texas cumulatively emit twice as much nitrogennoxide a key ingredient of smog as do all the nine million cars innTexas put togethernn  Only 7 percent of the more than 3500 tons of nitrogen oxidenemitted by the Enron Methanol plant in 1997 would have beennpermitted had Enron not gotten away with this under the grandfathernclause of the 1971 Texas Clean Air Act which allows plants builtnbefore 1971 to continue their polluting practices Bush extendednthis clause under the 1999 Clean Air Responsibility EnterprisenCARE program that his office drew up in a series of secretnmeetings with representatives of the top polluters in the state asnMolly Ivins reported CARE waives permit requirements for plantsnthat volunteer to cut emissionsnn  The CARE program is backed up by an act that Bush signed in Mayn1995 giving sweeping protections to polluters that perform internalnenvironmental or safety audits The law makes these audit documentsnconfidential and allows polluters to escape responsibility fornenvironmental violations To date Enron has conducted five suchnaudits and filed for immunity from prosecution for violations of thenlaw according to the Texas Natural Resources ConservationnCommission TNRCC the state equivalent of the EnvironmentalnProtection Agencynn  Tamara Maschini who lives about five miles from the Enron plantnis one of the founders of a local environmental group called CleannAir Clear Lakenn  Whole families in this neighborhood have asthma because of thenpollution from plants like Enron she saysnn  Mark Palmer head of public relations for Enron says that thencompanys contribution to local pollution is minimalnn  If the grandfather clause was canceled right now we would benefitnthe most of any of the companies in Texas because our nitrogen oxidenemissions add up to less than half a percent of the total he saysnn  Last year the Bush campaign borrowed Enrons corporate jets eightntimes to fly aides around the country more times than any of thenthirtyfour other companies that made their company aircraftnavailable to the Presidential hopefulnn  And Lay often acts as George W Bushs chaperonenn  On April 7 2000 he played host to Bush and his father the formernPresident at the Houston Astros first home game of the season Thengame was held in the baseball teams brand new stadiumEnronnFieldwhich was built with the help of a 100 million donation fromnEnron The company got free advertising a tax break and a 200nmillion contract to supply power to the stadium in returnnn  Less than three weeks later Lay joined candidate Bush innWashington DC for a Republican fundraiser that topped allnprevious records by bringing in a staggering 213 million easilynthe biggest onenight haul for any political party in historynn  Ken Lay is a noted business leader in Texas who has long beennactive in Republican politics says Ray Sullivan a spokesman fornthe Bush campaign He is chair of the Governors Business CouncilnBut the governor has his own agenda based on what he believes isnbest for Texas and for the countrynn  For his part Lay tries to put his contributions in a favorablenlight When I make contributions to a candidate it is not for somenspecial favor its not even for accessalthough Ill be the firstnto admit it probably helps access he told The New York Times Itnis because Im supporting candidates I strongly believe innpersonallynn  In January 1999 Enron pitched in 50000 to help pay for Bushsninaugural bash in Austin Texas after he won reelection forngovernor Today the polls show that George W Bush has a better thanneven chance of winning the Presidential

2000nCalling All Investors The New Power Companys IPO Priced at 21 Per SharenBy Will McNamara Director Electric Industry AnalysisnnnTNPC Inc parent of The New Power Company announced yesterday that itsninitial public offering IPO of 24 million common shares was priced atn21 per share The stock closed yesterday at 27 per share The Companynexpects to receive net proceeds from the offering of its shares at napproximatelyn473 million exclusive of the underwriters option to purchase an additionaln3600000 common shares to cover over allotments TNPC Incx01a partnershipnbetween Enron America Online AOL and IBMx01was formed in late 1999 tonprovide electricity and natural gas directly to households and small nbusinessesnin the deregulated energy marketplace TNPCs shares will be listed onnthe NYSE under the symbol NPW Closing of the offering is expected to occurnOct 11nnANALYSIS I am sure that many eyebrows were raised when TNPC issued thenIPO of its stock at 21 a figure that seemed surprisingly high for a startupncompany that has been in operation only since early summer It is rathernmindboggling that a company with no significant track record could opennits stock at such a price but it is not unheard of In fact TNPC is nfollowingna trend of new Internet companies initiating IPOs that are supported byngrand concepts rather than tangible success However the TNPC dream teamnalliance between Enron AOL and IBM has been met with great expectationsnand a lot of skepticism as well throughout the industrynnI read through the S1A filing that TNPC submitted to the SEC so hopefullynI can cut through the hype regarding this deal to get to its nucleus FirstnTNPC acknowledges repeatedly throughout its filing that it is enteringninto an extremely highrisk venture and in fact will incur substantialnoperating and net losses and cannot assure that we will attain nprofitabilitynFurther TNPC admits that it expects to incur these losses for a nsignificantnbut undetermined period of time Why then would Wall Street be greetingnthis IPO with such a positive welcome One could easily argue that thensheer market presence of Enron AOL and IBM has by association driven upnthe value of TNPC but I think a deeper answer lies within several factorsnnFirst TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments In two separatenprivate placements investors such as Enron GE Capital Equity Investmentsnand DLJMB Partners among others put up about 214 million in startupncapital in exchange for shares in the company Enron is the majority ownernof TNPC with 57percent control This money has allowed TNPC to make nimportantnacquisitions For instance TNPC bought the residential and small commercialnretail energy business of Columbia Energy Group which includes approximatelyn285000 naturalgas customers and 20000 electricity customers in eightnstates This is a valuable card in TNPCs deck as it locks in customersnduring this time when deregulation is developing slowly in retail marketsnI wouldnt be surprised if TNPC makes a similar acquisition of anotherncustomer base in the near future such as in Texas where customers havenbeen spun off to energy service companies rather than being held by thenTD operations of utilities In other words in Texas TNPC could easilynbuy customers without having to buy wires or infrastructure assuming therenis a willing sellernnSecond and perhaps more importantly earlier this year Enron transferrednits residential and small commercial retail operations in California andnOhio to TNPC This deal included the operations of Enron Energy Servicesnbut did not include PGE Energy Services which Enron acquired earliernthis year Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition TNPC hasncome out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer basenof over 325000 customers Why would Enron have turned over its residentialncustomers to TNPC  Dont forget that Enron struggled in and retreatednfrom the California residential market stating that it couldnt make anynmoney in the retail market TNPCs S1A filing confirms rumors that EnronnEnergy Services actually retreated from California due to a lawsuit claimingnthe company had violated laws relating to advertising directed to residentialnconsumers in 1997 and 1998 Enron was in fact banned from selling powernto the residential market in California Under this customer transfernEnron is able to put its money into a completely separate businessx01essentiallynmoving this highrisk business venture and worst performing part of itsnretail service off its own books Yet if TNPC succeeds Enron still benefitsnas it is the majority ownernnI think these two factors answer why Wall Street has looked so favorablynon a selfdescribed new company with a limited operating history Lookingnahead can TNPC maintain this comparatively high value of its stock  Wellntheres both good news and bad news for TNPC First lets look on thenbright side TNPC has put into place a great management team startingnwith H Eugene Lockhart formerly of ATT as president and CEO Othernkey players bring retail market expertise from work at MasterCard Exxonnand PespiCo In addition within the energy industry TNPC arguably couldnnot have a better backer than Enron What other companys touch has beenngolden in nearly every venture it has pursued In addition to being thenmajority owner Enron probably is also providing TNPC access to commoditiesnat preferential prices which will certainly enhance its sales approachnin the retail market Plus TNPC has access to the 24 million customersnthat AOL represents which Ive always thought was the companys secretnweaponnnBut then there are the risks and they are substantial First competitionnis not materializing rapidly on the retail side In a state like Pennsylvanianwhich perhaps represents the strongest deregulated market in the UnitednStates only about 16 percent of customers in PECOs territory have optednto switch their provider So TNPC has an uphill climb to say the leastnin making any inroads at capturing a lockx01and making moneyx01in the retailnmarket Second the only way that I can see TNPC making it at all is ifnthey continue to buy customers like they did from Columbia Energy GroupnThere are big questions surrounding whether the company will be able tondo this or not and much of its success hinges on this uncertaintynnThird and perhaps most serious of all is TNPCs vulnerability on thentechnology side of its operation TNPC has entered into a 10year revenuenmanagement and customer care agreement with IBM Global Services undernwhich IBM will manage the companys online commerce and billing applicationsnIBMs track record in developing customer care systems is less than stellarnIn fact PGE initiated a lawsuit against IBM a few years ago when thenutility had to pull the plug on a massive 100 million customer informationnsystem CIS employed by IBM which it claimed was ineffective IBM hasnpartnered with SCT to provide the infrastructure to be used by TNPC Undernan agreement between IBM Global Services and SCT the SCT Banner CIS willnbe integrated into a number of backoffice IT solutions under developmentnby IBM for TNPC Experts in the CIS industry have questioned whether SCTsnBanner CIS can handle over one million customers If it cannot this willnsurely limit TNPCs growth potentialnnMoreover although TNPCs IPO signals a strong future there are many nuncertaintiesnsurrounding this nascent operation As one of the few major players innthe energy retail market TNPC has very few competitors with the possiblenexceptions of NewEnergy or GreenMountain Another competitor is also emergingnin Britains Centrica which plans to expand in North America after itsnrecent acquisition of Canadian retail gas supplier Direct Energy nConsequentlynthe coming year could either make or break TNPC and the challenges thatnthe company faces in wanting to conquer the retail market are extremelynsteepnnnLearn more

httpwwwconsultrcicomwebinfostorensfProductsInfoGridnnnnSCIENTECH IssueAlert October 11 2000nOnline Niche Players Capitalize on NaturalGas Shortage Bypass UtilitiesnBy Will McNamara Director Electric Industry AnalysisnnnSmartEnergy a Con Edison competitor is offering New York and Westchester nconsumers price protection with the ability to lockin todays naturalgas nrates for a period of one year In a separate announcement myHomeKeycom nannounced that it will offer energy savings packages designed to reduce nenergy consumption and lower rates for customers in the face of rising nenergy costsnnANALYSIS As reports continue to accumulate that a naturalgas shortage nwill send prices skyrocketing this winter see my IssueAlert from Oct n9 on the subject the most common response from electric utilities has nbeen to warn their customers that they will see higher rates over the next nfew months I can point to several examples Minneapolisbased Xcel Energy nannounced a few weeks back that its naturalgas customers could face heating nbills that are 35 to 50 percent higher than their bills last winter Dominion nEast Ohio has warned its residential customers that they can expect to npay about 70 more per month for natural gas from November through January nAnd the warnings are coming not only in the Midwest and Northeastx01where nlow winter temperatures drive up energy bills every yearx01but in the West nas well In California PGE warns that its customers can expect to see ntheir winter bills increase by about 25 to an average bill of 75 compared nto 50 last winter These are just a few examples of utility companies nacross the United States playing damage control trying to minimize the ncustomer outrage when customers suddenly see their bills double or triplennAlong with their warnings these utilities give reasonsx01perhaps seen as nexcuses by the publicx01for the rising cost of energy There is a shortage nof natural gas across the country brought about by a dropoff in production nIt was an unusually hot summer which depleted supplies for energy Demand nin general has grown to surprising levelsnnMeanwhile startup online companies that many of us have not even heard nof are using the rise in naturalgas prices as a golden marketing nopportunity nand attempting to take business away from traditional utility companies nSmartEnergy is a perfect example In existence just since April 1999  nSmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small nbusiness customers According to EnergyGuidecom for an average home in nNew York City SmartEnergys naturalgas rates typically have run about n189 per month compared Con Edisons 140 Under its new promotion nSmartEnergys nplan for natural gas guarantees that New York City and Westchester gas ncustomers who sign on with their service now will be locked into current nnaturalgas rates for the next 12 months This promotion comes at an ideal ntime for those who opt to switch as naturalgas prices should begin their nprojected sharp increase over the next few weeks Based on recent forecasts nSmartEnergy is claiming that Con Edison customers who make the switch can nexpect to save up to 40 percent on their energy through the winter months nThe startup company also is offering 500 United Airlines Mileage Plus nReward Miles credit and 25 signup bonus to entice customers away from nCon Edison nnBased on the available information about SmartEnergy it is unclear how nthe online provider will be able to guarantee the 40percent reduction nin naturalgas rates I would presume that SmartEnergy has entered into nsome hedging strategies to minimize its risk in the event that naturalgas nprices remain high into the next year Any prudent provider would have na hedging strategy to protect itself and locking itself into 12month ncontracts without its own contracts for obtaining natural gas at spot market nprices would certainly raise questions about the future of SmartEnergy nIn addition SmartEnergy will have difficulty in recruiting customers away nfrom Con Edison and other utility providers Many customers still have nreservations about signing on with an online company that they do not know nThere will be some customers who jump at the chance to lock in current nrates for 12 months but many others will stick with the company that they nknow even if their rates increasennI did a quick search around Con Edisons Website to see if it might be noffering an alternative offer to retain its customers but could find nothing nthat the utility is doing to specifically address the projected increase nin naturalgas prices this winter Con Edison does offer a level billing nprogram in which customers receive a consistent bill amount each month nalleviating fluctuation in their bills Yet as a utility company Con nEdison has a standard offer of service that regulators closely monitor nIt is possible that Con Edison could request changes to the standard offer nservice which would likely need to be approved by the New York Public nService Commission The PSC could agree or determine that the competitive noffers by providers such as Smart Energy are a positive result of nderegulation nIn addition Con Edison could be hampered by fuel contracts that may not nallow it much flexibility with regard to lowering its rates Overall Con nEdison probably does not have a lot of flexibility regarding the rates nit can charge customers thereby making this offer from SmartEnergy difficult nto beatnnThe other online startup taking advantage of naturalgas prices is nmyHomeKeycom nwhich made a recent promise to reduce home heating oil naturalgas and nelectricity rates The marketing route that this online startup is taking nis energy efficiencyx01teaching households how to more effectively use their nenergy and hopefully save money as a result Energy is not the only service nof the myHomeKeycom it is also involved in home maintenance and repair nappliances home monitoring and moving services Yet I learned that nmyHomeKeycom njust recently launched cobranded sites with KeySpan Corp and TXU Energy nServices to provide millions of local customers with the ability to check nenergy efficiency in their homesnnWhats important to note about these two developments is the advantage nthat online energy providers have over traditional utilities As utilities ntry to disengage themselves from regulatorybound rate structures online ncompanies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products nand billing options to customers in deregulated states There are the online nproviders that we know about such as Utilitycom and Essentialcom nUtilitycom nhas not yet started to sell natural gas although it has established a npartnership with Sempra Energy in which Sempra Energy Trading will sell nnatural gas in deregulated markets via the Utilitycom Web site Utilitycom nplans to start selling natural gas by the end of this year but it has nnot developed any marketing campaign in this regard Essentialcom continues nto open up its service across the MidAtlantic and Northeast regions Yet non a weekly basis new startup online energy providers surface eager nto grab their own share of the retail market nnI also wonder where The New Power Company is in all of this rush to ncapitalize non the marketing opportunities surrounding the rise in naturalgas prices nIt would seem like a natural for TNPC to make a big splash with its own nmarketing efforts as it already promises lower prices for both natural ngas and electricity In any event as the naturalgas shortage may become na public relations nightmare for utility companies across the country nit conversely could work to the advantage of the more agile

Raising Ire of Generators TradersnBy Rebecca SmithnStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journalnn10302000nThe Wall Street JournalnA4nCopyright c 2000 Dow Jones  Company IncnnLOS ANGELES  In the latest attempt to fix Californias troubled deregulated nenergy market officials adopted a unique variablepricing plan that already nis being criticized by power generators and traders as unworkable and praised nby utilities and consumers as much needed protection against gouging nUnder the plan adopted late last week by the governing board of the nCalifornia Independent System Operator or ISO a quasipublic agency nresponsible for maintaining electricity reliability in the state the cap on nwholesale power will be reset hourly from about 65 per megawatt hour at nlowdemand times to no more than 250 an hour at periods of high demand It nwas the third time this year that officials effectively lowered the price cap non wholesale electricity in a bid to contain  so far unsuccessfully  nsoaring total power costsnThe move underscores the chaotic atmosphere prevailing in Californias power nmarket after a twoyearold experiment in deregulation has come undone In nother deregulated markets such as New York and New England prices are capped nat 1000 per megawatt hour which are intended to be low enough to prevent nmarket abuse but high enough to give generators incentive to build new nplants Californias system was supposed to work the same way But because nutilities in California divested themselves of the bulk of their plants but nwerent allowed to lock in fixedprice supply contracts unlike in the other nmarkets merchant generators have had much greater sway over prices here on nthe spot market where most power trades nDuring the first nine months of the year the average price of wholesale nelectricity was 90 per megawatt hour in California triple the price of a nyear earlier Even on cool days in October the price generally has remained nabove 100 per megawatt hour California utilities have lost money on those npower purchases because their customers rates are frozen at 54 to 65 per nmegawatt hour far lower than the average price utilities have had to pay for nthat power The deficits exceeded 5 billion in the JunetoSeptember period nCalifornia utilities buy the power used by their customers from the nstatesanctioned auctions administered by the ISO and a sister organization nthe California Power Exchange In New York and New England by comparison nless than 20 of power is purchased from the spot markets because utilities nthere were able to sign the fixedprice contracts which California utilities nwerent allowed to do The pricecap decision passed last week by a vote of n13 to 10 primarily with support from utilities and board members nrepresenting consumer interests It was pushed aggressively by Pacific Gas  nElectric Co and Southern California Edison the states two big ninvestorowned utilities that have gotten caught in the pricespike vise this nyear nSome ISO members say they had no choice but to support the measure to ratchet ndown price caps Were going after the windfall profits said S David nFreeman general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power nwho voted for the measure What weve got now is a market accustomed to nripping off the consumer This cant be allowed to go on nBut other experts said the hasty measure may make Californias problems even nworse The shortterm regulatory fix is always to fix prices said Pam nPrairie director of the Institute of Public Utilities at Michigan State nUniversity in East Lansing But theres a real danger youll set prices too nlow and make your supply problems even worse nOther economists agreed At best this is poorly administered costbased nregulation said Frank Wolak an economics professor at Stanford University nwho sits on an independent marketmonitoring committee at the ISO At worst nit creates all sorts of perverse market incentives nFor example it may increase the problem of megawatt laundering on hot days nin which instate generators sell power to outofstate customers who then nsell it back into the state effectively bypassing the cap Likewise it ncould encourage generators to build new plants outside of California rather nthan where they are needed near its major cities also to avoid the cap In nthe end it could increase stresses to the states already overburdened ntransmission system nIn fact the decision already has brought to a halt the states forward nelectricity market which allows wholesale customers to sign contracts for npower they will use in the future The market had been trading as much as n1000 contracts a week On Friday there was practically no activity nThis decision shows the height of lunacy said Rick Shapiro a managing ndirector at Enron Corp the giant Houstonbased energy trader Mr Shapiro nsaid Enron and other generators will file appeals at the Federal Energy nRegulatory Commission asking that the new pricing formula be rescinded nIt is possible the FERC may throw out the pricing formula anyway It is nexpected to issue a major order on Nov 1 directing changes in Californias nmarket structure That order will include its determination of the neffectiveness of price caps It also is expected to judge the merits of the ngovernance structure at the ISO which has lately been marked by infighting nRecently consumer groups have charged that the ISO board has put the nbusiness interests of its members ahead of members fiduciary duty to nCalifornia residents nThe most recent pricecap measure was approved over the objections of nexecutives at the ISO whose job it will be to implement the formula ISO nChief Executive Terry Winter said the measure is flawed because it doesnt ntake into account the amount of power available to the California market Mr nWinter fears the caps will place the state at a disadvantage relative to nneighboring states with no price caps About 11 states are electrically ninterconnected in the West meaning power can be moved between them and chase nthe highest prices nWe keep getting accused of making our market too complicated Mr Winter nsaid Then along comes this proposal with caps that would adjust repeatedly nthroughout the day depending on demandnnCopyright  2000 Dow Jones  Company Inc All Rights Reserved

and now serves as chief of staff Johnson said nobody has nbeen interviewed for any Washington post but he has compiled a file of folks nwho are interested in serving in a Bush administration nJohnson also has been reading up on previous transitions  ones that went nwell and ones that didnt His preliminary conclusion is that the outgoing nadministrations are generally helpful and supportive even if they were nousted by the incoming administration Its the incoming administrations that ncan make the mistakes he said nThere is no shortage of think tanks that have thinktanked the topic Back in nAugust the Heritage Foundation based in Washington issued a transition nhandbook titled The Keys to a Successful Presidency nThough we really dont expect either campaign to talk about it and would ndiscourage them from doing so the message here is its time to start nplanning for a possible presidential transition quietly well behind the nscenes but with the understanding that the preparation done during the next n70 or so days and the work done in the 70 or so days that follow between nthe election and the inauguration will very well determine the initial nsuccess or failure of the next

effort for the presidential campaign nHowever not everyone has Potomac Fever For example Terral Smith Bushs nlegislative director said he will stay in Austin to lobby nIn addition to the speculation about appointees the approaching election has nsparked talk about when Bush might leave office if he wins Under the US nConstitution he could remain governor until he has to become president on nJan 20 nMuch more likely however is that Bush would leave office sooner than that nperhaps as soon as two or three weeks after the Nov 7 election if he wins nThat could cause a housing problem for Bush whose main residence is the nGovernors Mansion which comes as a free perk of the job The Bushes have a nhome under construction at their ranch in Crawford near Waco The ranch also nhas a smaller house in which the Bushes now spend weekends nNot out of the question is that Bush could work out an arrangement with Lt nGov Rick Perry who would become governor if Bush resigns to remain in the nGovernors Mansion for several weeks after he leaves office nIf the race among Texas senators to replace Perry as lieutenant governor ncomplicates the timing of the resignation Bush could stay in the governors noffice a little longer but no later than the first week of January After nall he will want to give Perry time to bask in his gubernatorial ninauguration before the Legislature convenes Jan 9 nNo

come to a very successful conclusion and the new rates nwill go into effect towards the end of this month  The rates are not much nlower than what we filed for and represent a very significant increase over nthe previous rates  The tariff methodology and revised regulations put into neffect by the Supreme Decree were followed to the letter by the regulator ndespite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down  The deliverables nhere were to 1 obtain a tariff methodology via Supreme Decree that would nmake the company financeable  rescue it from dire financial straits and 2 nfile a rate case and prosecute it to obtain hard rates in accordance with the ntariff methodology  This second deliverable has now been completed  nTransredes has had a bond issue pending since last year due to the nuncertainty about rates it is my understanding that the financial market nloved the ruling and that Transredes sold 40 million worth of bonds in about n5 minutes  This ruling should also significantly increase Transredess nmarket value relative to Enrons efforts to sell its interest in the companynn Forwarded by Ray AlvarezNAEnron on 05142001 1138 nAM nnDoug Farmern05112001 0609

Interest rate reduced to 10 or 105  ie the rate in our bond issuen4 Liquids expansion in the South reducedn5 Some continuity of service CAPEX reducedn6 Unknown OPEX reduction and maybe a change to the OPEX allocation between nconcesionsn7 OCC in service date slipped from 2003 to 2004n8 DebtEquity assumption changed from 6040 to 7030nnOur strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows nn1 Volumes  Covered by 8 rule we can blete but can expect little back nhere  Clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the nshort term ie 20022003n2 RG Compression  not worth fighting for since we dont even have the nsupport of BGn3 Interest Rate  Well get this back when we do a tariff  revision and nactual rates are used  When we get the detail we will appeal if Jan feels we nhave concrete grounds ie commision costs etc are omitedn4 Liquids Expansion in the South  Here we intend to do a detailed analysis nof exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquidsgas production nwill be shut in  If possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected nproducers PB BG Vintage and Chaco  We will then write to those nproducerscopy SIRESE  VMEH etc stating that on their recommendation the nproject scope was reduced by SIRESE  We will give them an estimate of the nlost liquidsgas production in both volume and cash terms resultant from nthis decision  We will tell them that since they proposed these reductions nwe have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appealn5 Continuity of Service Capex  We need to see the detail here  We will ntake the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared nto compromise our safety and environmental standards  We need to see exactly nwhat has been removed but my thought is that if that means we are unable to nprovide some services eg LPG transportation or the continued operation of nsome liquids laterals we should write to those producers affected suggesting nthat if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the ndecision  Again since this is Capex we will get it back in the end on tariff nrevisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the nSIRESE budget processn6 OPEX  need to see the detail on Mondayn7 OCC  will not appeal  we need to do a detailed study to develop an OCC nstrategyn8 DebtEquity ratio  Strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance nwith the LawRegulation  the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is n40  However we have very strong grounds to appeal since  a we are ncurrently miles away from 6040 let alone 7030 b we can only borrow for nCAPEX as per bond issue and the policy of allmost bankslending ninstitutions with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover n100 of CAPEX we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from n6040  We intend to fight this one very hard using all the nexternalindependant help we can getnnAs you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much nneeded substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we nwould be subjected to some form of arbitary cut  This has not happened nSIRESE has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases  Having ngot the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above nstrategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much nsmaller and hence managable increasesnnAttached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above npoints and the corporate model using the new tariff with our

decided to pass this info along because I think its a red flag  nMy concern is that there might not only be a backlash affecting our ninterstate pipelines but that our gas marketing efforts might be adversely naffected  It might well be found that the holders of the firm capacity ie nmarketers and not the pipes themselves are at fault for the large basis ndifferentials between the basins and the CA delivery points  Whoever is nblamed might not really matter  My gut feeling is that the other shoe is nabout to drop with calls for price caps on gas commodity prices into the nWest  This of course could affect years of effort on the gas marketing nside in establishing competitive markets  Pipeline open access is of no navail if there is government intervention in the gas markets  Commissioner nMassey Senator Feinstein and other Western Senators were saying some very nconcerning things about gas prices the impacts in their states and that nsomething needed to be done  FERC responded with an announcement of their ntechnical conference on interstate pipeline capacity  and intrastate take naway capacity which by the way doesnt appear to address storage  nEveryone wants an explanation as to why the basis differential is much higher nthan in other states since they thought it should only consist of transport ncosts  Raynn Forwarded by Ray AlvarezNAEnron on 05042001 0918 nAM nnnRay

prices were controversial  Commissioner Massey kicked off the discussion non this issue citing a transport basis differential into CA of 10 when it nwas less than a dollar in other areas  He then noted that the high gas cost nwould adversely affect the power price under the auction and that FERC must nact regarding the high transport differentials We will never get a handle non electric prices unless we get a handle on gas prices  That opened the nfloodgates of discussion culminating with the announcement by Commissioner nBreathitt of FERCs technical conference notice of which issued today on nthe topic of current and projected interstate pipeline capacity and adequacy nof infrastructure within CA  She said that this would shed light on basis ndifferentials and gas pricesnnFreudian slip

were dominated by California officials Cal nEnergy Commission Cal Air Resources Board Chairman of Gov Davis Generation nImplementation Task Force  In addition there were witnesses from the nWestern Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA  The Senate witnesses were the nthree FERC commissionersnnHIghlightsnnChairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton nbill HR 1647 next week many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will nhappen we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will nreport back with more information and conclusions once that is done nChairman Barton also said he may go to California next weeknThere was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that nhigher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate nincreases several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation ncosts for similar differences between California and nonCA states FERC at nthe Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical nconference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as nit relates to California a House member from Southern Illinois coal country nattacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plantsnThe House witnesses primarily BPA but also the California witnesses nattacked the negawatt provision in sec 102 of the Barton bill the criticism nwas that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high nprice since it is short sell it to the DSIs under contract let the DSI sell nit at market rates and capture the difference BPA witness said that thus nsec 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their nstrategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10101 BPA ntestimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region nto support sec 102nBoth hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a nprice cap at the House hearing none of those advocating a price cap among nthe witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could nbe done the witnesses just said cost plus a reasonable profit and said nleave the details to FERC at afternoon Senate hearing Chairman Hebert had nthe staff bring in 15 boxes from one FPL case to show how a price cap would ntake too long to bring any relief to California this summer he said last nweeks soft price cap is much betternAlso on the price cap Rep Walden ROR  got the Cal Energy Comm chair to nadmit that if the price caps had been in place earlier California would NOT nhave taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken nrecently nThe interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it nwas a House hearing on Tuesday although it could have been worse when nSenate Chairman Murkowski RAK said that help is on the way in the form nof the nominees for the two vacancies Sen Dorgan DND made a comment that nsuggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth the same concern ncame from the interplay among the Senators which was also somewhat ncontentious at timesnnPlease advise if you have any

discussed at the Commission nmeeting held tonight at approximately 7 PM EST and additional intelligence ngathered from FERC staffers after the meeting by Joe HartsoennPhysical Withholding  To prevent physical withholding the plan will nrequire sellers with PGAs to offer all their available power in real time  nAll California generators even those not subject to FERC price regulation nwill be required to sell into the ISOs real time market as a condition of ntheir use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric nfacilities will be exempted 247 for 1yr nnPrice Mitigation   The plan will establish a single market clearing price nauction for the real time market  During Stage 1 2 and 3 emergencies in the nISOs real time market each generator other than hydro with a nparticipating generator agreement is required to offer all available power nand bid its marginal cost based on the generators heat curve emission nrates gas costs and emission costs plus 2 for OM  The gas cost will be nthe average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California nemissions are to be based on Cammon Fitzgerald  The gas cost and nemissions will be published the day after for use on the following day  A nsingle market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators  nHighest bid sets the clearing price  Each gas fired generator must file with nFERC and the ISO on a confidential basis heat and emission rates for each ngenerating unit  The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost nfor each generator including maintenance and operating costs  In the event na generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price the generator must nwithin 7 days of the end of each month file a report with FERC and the ISO njustifying its price  FERC has 60 days to reviewact  No opportunity costs nin real time  Marketers are in the same boat as they must be prepared to njustify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with nno opportunity cost  However credit sleeves are permissiblennDemand Response  Beginning June 1 only public utility load serving entities nmust submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be ncurtailed under those bids  FERC is attempting to break the demand curve  n247  nnOutages  PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced noutages in accordance with the Commission Staff proposal adopted by FERC nnTerm  Order expires one year from date of issuancennRTO Filing  California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June 1 nor Order lapses with no further effectnnISO Reporting  On September 14 2001 ISO must file a status report on how nthings are working and how much generation has been built  Comments are due nin 15 days  Quarterly reports thereafternnRevocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds  The market based rate nauthority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1 no physical withhold nof capacity and 2 no inappropriate bidding behavior  Inappropriate bidding nbehavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the ngeneration unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit nbehavior  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be ninappropriate  In addition hockey stick bids are expressly prohibited nie  bidding 95 at marginal cost and 5 at a much higher levelnnLimited 206 filing  Applies to sales in the WSCC outside California  nRefund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a ncontrol area falls below 7  Control areas are not required to publish when nthis condition occurs  Apparently anything over marginal cost must be njustified  All marketers and nonhydroelectric generators must offer to sell ncontractually and physically available capacityenergy to a location within nWSCC  FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California  nComments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations  The refund effective ndate is 60 days from publication of the OrdernnNox Limits in California   Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is nprohibited from running by law  However it appears that incurring fines ndoes not overcome the must sell requirement just include the fines as part nof the price bid  Also if Nox is limited may seek to show that generation nwould have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price  nnSurcharge to pay past amount due  Comments are due in 30 days on 1 whether nFERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow

offices as a copy of what nwas sent to Jeff Skilling and other CEOs of major companies  I have not nconfirmed our receipt of such a letter from any of you but am assuming it nwas deliverednnI think we could respond in a very positive constructive manner to nGreenpeace based on the statements weve already documented and the nstrategies we are developing  Lisa Jacobson and I are currently working on ndeveloping some tighter climate change and clean air messages that we can nuse in multiple areas ASAP  upcoming Ken Lay speeches and interactions with nthe Administration revising the Statement for the 2001 Corporate nResponsibility Report Enron Business articles and other internal uses nresponses to environmental group inquiries and shareholder meeting QA and nuse in everyday speeches and advocacy worknnThe Greenpeace questions are tricky and set up nowin answers for the most npart  I doubt they will get any direct answers to questions like  Does nyour company support President Bush in his opposition to the protocol   In nmy opinion we can respond to Greenpeace without directly responding to these ntypes of questions  Addressing Kyoto directly is a slippery slope  its nbest to stick with the solutionoriented approach weve always takennnFor this reason I was a bit concerned to see in the email chain below a ncharacterization of Mark Palmers statement on Kyoto given to Jackie Gentile nin London  Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was nnot a workable solution to dealing with CO2 emissions  However it is not the nprinciples behind Kyoto that we take issue with rather it is the vehicle nthat has been devised to deliver the results  I believe it is dangerous to nmake such statements for a number of reasons  Greenpeace would absolutely nbeat us over the head with it Friends of the Earth could step up its nshareholder initiatives etc    Also this sets you up for a number of nfollow up questions that I dont think we have answers to like  What about nKyoto is not workable  What would make it workable and would we help make it nworkable  If not Kyoto what is Enrons preferred vehicle  Id really nrather stay with a constructive solutionoriented approach and avoid nreference to Kyoto altogethernnI will talk with Kate Bauer in Enron Europe about this but I think we need nto decide on a global corporatewide response to Greenpeace   I would be

bThanks so much for your message  Your communications are always complete nfirm clear and polite  I am sorry that perhaps the most critical aspect of nyour efforts  security has been so confused by our end  I understand nfrom John Brindle that the confusion generated by our end has not kept you nfrom accomplishing a great deal of the work anyway  I have asked John to nlead the effort to the extent you need him  John and his team are very nexperienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the London noffice  Mike Hicks is a good hand but for the most part all I have asked nhim to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the narea in question  It is a bit too much to ask Mike to be hands on for all of nEnrons corporate security needs  A little background Ill bore you with  nafter Andre Legallo formerly VP of Security for Enron left we did not nreplace his function  Most of the operating companies had their own security nand business controls groups  When Andre left we reduced the corporate nfunction to a default provider role  if a business unit had a need it was nnot otherwise meeting Mike Hicks as well as an outside consulting firm nwould help identify competent resources in the area  With the reorganization nof EBS I have inherited the very competent and experienced team they had nassembled led by John Brindle  John identified some concerns regarding nIndia mid last week  I urged him to get in touch with Rebecca he did  It nwas clear after further inquiries by John that the India team had already naddressed many if not all of the concerns and much of the remaining work ninvolved implementation  John volunteered to send some people over to help nand I said OK  He had already been in touch with the London team and Mike nHicks who I have asked to return to HoustonnnThe last thing you need right now is confusion caused by a group saying nwere from corporate and were here to help  If you dont need any help nor if the situation gets anything other than significantly better let me nknownnnnTo Steven J KeanNAEnronEnronncc Rebecca McDonaldEnronEnronXGate James A HughesEnronEnronXGate nnSubject India

hear that from me Once we realized we nhad a major issue on our hand and I received clearance from Rebecca and Jim nto bring some HR folks into the loop HR had someone on a plane within 20 nhours of my first call We have always had great HR support through Drew nLynch and Bob Sparger helping our team led by Sandip Malik and this time nScott Gilchrist has joined in and helped as well But the two workhorses have nbeen Bob and Sandip Bob got on a plane immediately and came over and he and nSandip have been working around the clock so that we are much better prepared nnow than we were just a couple of days back We really relied heavily on HR nand Drew had his team there for usnn2 PR top notch team of John Ambler and Johan Zaayman working with and nsupporting Jimmy Mogal on the ground Johan and Jimmy have been a strong team non the ground and John has provided leadership and all coordination with nHouston Great efforts and productive worknn3 Security This area has not worked as well and if you ever want feedback non our onetime experience with this group I will provide it I dont have nany idea who is in charge from Enrons perspective here There are 2 groups nheaded this way Mike Hicks will arrive Thursday night and Mike has informed nus that he will be leading all security efforts Jim Rountree is apparently ntravelling with Mike and Don Hawkins sent me an email earlier today telling nme that Don has instructed Jim that Jim is in charge of coordinating our nsecurity John Brindle has sent me an email saying that you have asked him nto coordinate and help in the ongoing efforts and John is sending 3 people nover arriving Saturday night First we are very happy to have the help but nI just hope that Mike Jim and John know which of the three are in charge If nyou could just let me know who you want to be in charge we will coordinate nwith that personnnOn a side note the people who have really been helpful were brought in nthrough Drew Lynch of Europe HR They are Jim Roth and Dave Lawler both of nwhom work for John Sherriff They had a great attitude were willing to work nday and night and were planning on coming to coordinate until Mike decided he nwould comennAt Mikes earlier suggestion we engaged Hill  Associates to help on nsecurity Because I was having to meet with them 3 to 4 times per day I nasked Jane Wilson to help coordinate all our security efforts Jane has done na fantastic job in an impossibly short time frame The tasks she has been noverseeing include coordinating with Hill  Associates removing in a lowkey nyet rush manner over 400 boxes of files and documents and getting them nthrough customs and to Europe removing 2 container truck loads of files from nthe Dabhol site and getting them out of the country and overseeing a ncomplete security check and file removal of all our electronic files from nservers desktops and laptops In addition she has coordinated security for nall expats and families as well as worked with EOGIL expats and Anthony nDuenner of EBS AsiannAgain we appreciate all the help nnWadenn,1

efforts to become the 1st Fortune n500 Company that has a 100 green headquarters  Weve established a ncompanywide team and a working plan going forward which includesnn1  EES commodity team is going to run the numbers for energy commodity for nfacilities and give them a proposal by end of next week  While facilities nwill not be part of the TX pilot EES can arrange a financial deal for them nw an option of going physical on 1102   EES commodity team will also let nthe group know of the offer in order to structure the REC deal  Depending nupon the savings that EES can offer to Facilities we will determine any nheadroom for REC purchasesnNote It is not necessary for Facilities to sign a commodity deal w EES in norder for the greening of the building to go forward  The RECs can be npurchased and retired irrespective of the commodity deal with EES  HOWEVER nit would be optimum for Facilities to sign on w EES and use the cost savings ntoward purchase of the RECs  Facilities stated intent to do the lattern2 Michael Payne and Mike Curry are going to be working on determining a cost nfor the RECs  Michael initially projected 250000 per year for the nrequisite number of RECs to retire commensurate w the demand of the nbuilding  This was at a cost of 8 per REC which I believe is quite high  nI think theyll go for a 14 dollar range bringing the cost down to a max nof 125000  Theres several ways to slice this end  We can provide some of nthe RECs from the EWC facility and buy other RECs from the market in order to nminimize the cost impact of the REC purchasesn3  Next Thursday we will be able to get more of an exact figure on the npremium cost for the RECs ie how much over the cost savings will the RECs ncost  We will then need to decide the followingn a Would CorpEHS being will to pitch in to cover any additional cost for nthe RECsn b Pitching the idea to Skilling for buyoff and payment for the RECsn c Possibly getting buyoff from the business units since this could change nwhat they are currently paying for powern4 We discussed all of the above with Peggy Mahoney and she asked us to take na stab at a comprehensive press release announcing all of the bells and nwhistles on the new building and our being the 1st Fortune 500 company to go n100 green in our headquarters   Catherine McKalip Thompson is working on nthe first draft  We need to determine if we can get the best press for nthis commitment ie stories in the WSJ and NY Times  We determined that nthe message would need to be targeted specifying the terms of our ncommitmentie Enron makes a

Thursday 322 afternoon at 200 to ndiscuss energy commodity and renewable energy credits for the Enron Building nCenter and Stadium  There are a few efforts that are going on simultaneously nand I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the nsame page  As many of you might know Enron Wind Michael Payne and ENA nMike Curry have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from nour Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium ndetails attached below  If this proposal goes forward Enron would be the n1st Fortune 500 company to go green in its headquarters building  Couple nthis w our energy star award and we have GREAT environmental messaging   nWed like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day April 22ndnnThe facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for nactual commodity  It makes sense to work strategically together on winwin nproposal that will not only make sense economically but that we can use in nour messaging  The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals nand steps for moving forward   nnThe meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 200300 Please let me know if you or

Andrew Steffes James D Keeney Kevin Adzgery RonaldnCctSharp Vicki Sanders Richard B Haedicke Mark E Mellencamp Lisa Tribolet Michael Curry Wanda Huddleson DiannnSubjecttEES Billing IssuesnnPrivileged and Confidential AttorneyClient CommunicationnnThis is to recap our discussion today about two billing issuesrecoupment of the PX Credit and the 10 surcharge  I would appreciate it if those of you with more firsthand information particularly Wanda and Diann correct or clarify anything Ive misstated  Also please forward this to anyone else with an interest in this matternnA  Recoupment of the PX Credit also known as the Negative CTCnn     1  Background  The issue here relates to the fact that PGE and SCE are no longer reflecting credit balances on the bills for our customers  Prior to our returning the customers to bundled service in March the bills would reflect the PX Credit as an offset to TD charges  SCE and PGE have now removed the PX Credit from the bill and are attempting to charge us for TD despite the fact that they owe us hundreds of millions of dollars in PX Credits  This is potentially harmful particularly in view of the opinion of perhaps three of the Commissioners that the PX Credit can only be collected as a bill credit and not in cash  Mike Day our regulatory lawyer expressed his strong opinion that removing the Credit from the bills was improper and that we should challenge the action by making a filing with the CPUC  Note  the PX Credit to which I am referring here is that which accrued to prior to December 31 2000 the utilities do not dispute that a PX Credit accrued during that time frame and there is no dispute as to the proper methodology for computing the PX Credit for that time frame  Furthermore PGE and SCE are in virtual agreement with us as to the amount of the Credit that had accrued as of December 31 2000nn    2   Action ItemsIssues  a  With respect to SCE Legal is evaluating filing a suit in federal court versus filing at the CPUC  The CPUC has a process whereby we could prevent the utilities from disconnecting our customers while the issue is being determined by depositing the payments in an interestbearing account controlled by the CPUC while there is no equivalent procedure in federal court one can request that the court enter an injunction against the utilities disconnecting customers   While the analysis is worth doing I suspect that we will conclude that we have to go to the CPUC for relief  b  With respect to PGE the banruptcy team is evaluating whether to file at the CPUC or in bankruptcy courtnn    3  Timing  Late fees will begin accruing August 20  The first disconnect notices would not be received until September 19nn    4  Effect on other CTC issues  Pursuing action at the CPUC or in court to force the utilities to restore the PX Credit to our bills has no effect on the issues of how the CTC should be calculated postJanuary 17 and prospectivelynnB  10 Surchargenn     1  Backgound  Although when provisionally imposed in January the 10 surcharge went to the utilities to keep them financially solvent  when made permanent in March it became dedicated to defray the DWRs purchases of power on behalf of the utilities  This evolution gives rise to two bases for EES to argue that it should not bear the financial burden of the 10 surcharge  First since the 10 surcharge is now dedicated to purchasing generation for bundled customers only and not direct access customers direct access should not have to pay it  This is the same logic that caused the CPUC to exempt direct access customers from the 30 surchargenSecondly if legitimately applied to direct access because it is of no direct benefit to direct access customers it arguably can only be viewed as a tax  Under EESs contracts with its customers taxes assessed at the delivery point are borne by the customer  Note  SCE unlike PGE may not impose the 10 surcharge on direct access customers according to a filing made at the staff level at the CPUC so this action may relate to PGE onlynn     2  Action ItemsIssues  a  Regulatory Jim Steffes has the lead in advising us about a challenge to the application of the 10 surcharge to direct access customers at the CPUC  It may be advisable for an industry group rather than Enron to make the filing  b  I would expect that we would follow the same procedure outlined abovedepositing the payment with the CPUCto prevent any customer from being disconnected  In the interim we would likely bill the customer for the surcharge and promise a credit if our challenge to the application of the surcharge to DA customers is successful c A decision will need to be made on how far we go backto July 1 when the customers became DA again or to January 4 when the surcharge was first imposednn     3  Timing  Same timeframe as with the Recoupment issue since we will need to have CPUC challenge on file to prevent late fees and disconnect noticesnn     4  Effect on other CTC issues  Regulatory Jim Steffes will analyze with the appropriate people the effect if any of taking this position on other CTC issues principally how CTC should be calculated postJanuary 17 and prospectively nnEnd

around the world continue to strugglenwith the problem of incentivizing generators whose output due to theirnlocation in the grid has no viable substitutes  Such generators possessnlocal market power  Since these generators also compete in broadernregional markets the actions taken to exploit their local market power cannalso effect market outcomes over larger areas  In California a contractnstructure known as the reliability mustrun RMR contract was developed tonaddress the problem of local market power  However the contract form thatnwas in place during 1998 created serious incentive problems  We find thatnduring the months of June through September 1998 RMR contracts had theneffect of raising overall supply bid prices from most producers therebynleading to higher energy

electricitynmarket are slated for September 2000 Some of the changes will bring the UKnin line with what other countries have done but other changes will benunique Is the UK poised to leapfrog the rest of the world adopting everynmarket feature that has proved successful and modifying those that havennot Should the rest of the world be following the UKs lead on some ofnthese changes This paper argues that the answer is a decisive no to bothnquestions While proposed reforms to introduce demandside bidding andnencourage financial innovation make sense the governments proposal to paynsuppliers

regulatory environment many options exist  Innparticular the use of incentive regulation programs in US electricitynmarkets has grown during the past two decades These programs differ innboth their goals and how they attempt to meet these goals In this paper Indiscuss the wide array of programs that have been utilized and investigatenthe impact of individual programs on the technical efficiency of a largenset of coal and natural gas generator units Within a stochastic frontiernframework I allow the distribution of inefficient production to be anfunction of the regulatory environment the

BlumsteinnnCalifornia electricity consumers can choose a retail electricity servicenprovider but most have not done so These consumers remain by defaultncustomers of the utility distribution companies UDCs Pricing electricitynfor these default customers is now an issue before the California PublicnUtilities Commission In California this issue is framed largely in termsnof two alternatives pass through of the wholesale electricity price or anperformancebased rate PBR Under the first alternative purchase fromnthe California Power Exchange PX would be mandatory under the secondneach UDC would determine where to purchase supply and each UDCsnperformance would be gauged by comparing its costs to the PX price Thisnpaper identifies issues that should be addressed in choosing between thentwo alternatives First the paper examines the effects of the twonalternatives on electricity prices The analysis suggests that at least innthe near term the choice will not have much effect on prices Next thenpaper looks at possible perverse incentives A central concern here isnthat if providing default service becomes profitable UDCs might use theirndistribution assets to stifle competition in the retail market Finallynthe paper examines regulatory costs associated with the alternatives andnconcludes that regulatory costs are likely to be higher under a PBRnnDownload this paper in Adobe Acrobat

andnMultiProduct Electricity Firms  July 1999n PWP065 by Christopher R KnittelnnElectricity and natural gas markets have traditionally been serviced by onenof two market structures In some markets electricity and natural gas arensold by a dualproduct regulated monopolist while in other marketsnelectricity and natural gas are sold by separate singleproduct regulatednmonopolies This paper analyzes the relative pricing and investmentndecisions of electricity firms operating in the two market structures Thenunique relationship between these two products namely that electricity andnnatural gas are substitutes in consumption and natural gas is an input intonthe generation of electricity allows me to gain inferences regarding thenefficacy of regulation in both the electricity and natural gas industriesnThe results imply that both electricity prices and reliance on natural gasngeneration are higher in a dualproduct setting both suggestive thatnregulators respond to the relative incentives of electricity and naturalngas firmsnnDownload this paper in Adobe Acrobat formatnhttpwwwuceiberkeleyeduuceiPDFpwp065pdfnn     nnnnDiagnosing Market Power in Californias Deregulated Wholesale ElectricitynMarket  July 1999n PWP064 by Severin Borenstein James Bushnell and Frank WolaknnEffective competition in wholesale electricity markets is the cornerstonenof the deregulation of the electricity generation industry We examine thendegree of competition in the California wholesale electricity market duringnJuneNovember 1998 by comparing the market prices with estimates of thenprices that would have resulted if all firms were price takers We findnthat there were significant departures from competitive pricing and that itnwas most pronounced during the highest demand periods Overall this raisednthe cost of power purchases by about 22 above the competitive level Wenalso explain why the prices observed cannot be attributed to competitivenpeakload

decentralized operations in powerngrids has focussed on partitioning systems initially into two main partsnthe transmission system and the market of users the ISO and the PXnand asking how the actions of these two subgroups can be properlyncoordinated  While a number of studies have gone on to examinendecentralized operations in the user market of producers and consumersnlittle attention has been given to how the operation of the transmissionnsystem itself might be decentralized  In this paper we propose annorganizational procedure for coordinating the actions of the managers ofngiven subgrids

bWhen we have described the problems and solutions for California we have nfocussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge  We have stayed away nfrom transmission issues on the assumption that California with its ISO and nPX does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the ncountry  Is this true  Does Californias system layer in priorities for nutility use of the system  eg doesnt PGE control path 15  Does that ncontrol provide advantageous access to PGE  Are there other examples and nare there links between these preferences and the current problems in nCalifornia  As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns ninto FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us,1

It sounds like this consultants findings are being questioned by many nin the industry including by the CAISOnnPortland OreBased Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity NeedsnDan McSwain  North County Times Escondido Califnn October 17 2000 nnnnOct 13PORTLAND OreA private investigation of state power markets has ncome to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating ncapacity this summernnThe state enjoyed a 32 percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared nand the states power manager declared 36 separate power emergencies nbecause California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage naccording to the investigationnnThe author of the investigations preliminary report Portlandbased neconomist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough said at a nconference of analysts power traders and electricity industry regulators nThursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies nmanipulated the production of power from June through August to create a nfalse shortage and push up pricesnnThe Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example it ran at well nbelow its full capacity for much of June even though wholesale power prices n and consumer electricity bills  shot to well above the generating nplants cost of productionnnThe actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an nanalysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency which monitors nemissionsnnWe are seeing a lot of undergeneration McCullough said This is market npower in actionnnMarket power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market nparticipants  in this case suppliers  to influence pricesnnMany of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed ntheir belief that supply shortages were very real this summer and ncontributed to high prices but several participants said deregulation has nreduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts nMainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal nagencies including the EPAnnConventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego nCounty are scantnnEncinas operators a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc and NRG nEnergy Inc called Cabrillo Power confirmed that the power plant had no nabnormal maintenance problems The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said nWednesday that the power plant was well within its statemandated pollution nlimitsnnBut David Lloyd the corporate secretary of Cabrillo denied that the Encina nplant has been used to game the San Diego County power marketsnnThat cant possibly be right Lloyd said of McCulloughs analysis In nNorth County we were right on the ragged edge of being off an emergency nshutdown because of heavy outputnnWithout knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off nI cant comment Lloyd saidnnWe certainly dont want to be accused of anything wrongful he said We ndont have that much power in California and for us to be shutting down in nCalifornia to push up the price somewhere else doesnt make sense for us We nwant to run all we can when the prices are highnnElectricity prices have soared to record levels since May resulting in a ndoubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the 12 million ncustomers of San Diego Gas  Electric Co and causing an estimated 5 billion nin losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas  ElectricnnState lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with na retail rate cap but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow nbeyond 300 million if high wholesale prices persistnnNo fewer than five private state and federal investigations are under way to nassess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western nstates The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies nwhich produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit nderegulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright nmanipulation in order to increase profitsnnInquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission Electricity nOversight Board and attorney general along with a Federal Energy Regulatory nCommission investigation were launched in July and August Staff ninvestigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they nare still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market datannMcCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium nof large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate nthe price spikes His effort is thought to be the first to complete an nexhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount nof electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that nwas actually usednnChief among McCulloughs findings was that demand for power was lower this nsummer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council na federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web nof power transmission lines that connect California to 13 other Western nstates British Columbia and northern MexiconnMcCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North nCounty Times and the initial reaction of the states energy community was none of deep skepticismnnEPA data is notoriously unreliable said Frank Wolak a Stanford professor nand the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California nIndependent System Operator the agency that manages the state grid and which nhas paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer To gauge the actual noutput of power plants that burn fossil fuel McCullough used emissions data nfrom the EPAnnGreed would get the best of anybody Wolak said I found a lot of hours nwhere instate generators were exceeding nameplate capacity These guys were ncranking it outnnWolak in a study of power markets for the system operator did conclude nhowever that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was nthe major cause of higher prices this summernnAt the conference in Portland most of the panelists did not openly criticize nMcCulloughs analysis but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing nhigher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real nshortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western statesnnLow hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures nin the Southwest were blamed for limiting Californias ability to import nelectricitynnOthers said state and federal regulators along with market participants nthemselves wont really know what happened until more experts look at hard nmarket information that is in short supplynnRon Eachus the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission said nmarket information is routinely withheld from regulators the public and nbuyers of electricity but is shared among power generators and trading ncompaniesnnIf the market is sharing it with themselves but not us I dont buy that nEachus saidnnTim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America the nlargest marketer and trader of electricity in the world Enron takes the nunique stand that more information which has been labeled proprietary by ncompanies such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is nselling for should be made available instantly to the marketsnnIs there a smoking gun out there or are

bCalifornia Officials Investigate Electric Megawatt LaunderingnSteve Johnson  San Jose Mercury News Califnn October 31 2000 nnnnOct 30While investigating this summers stunning spike in electricity nprices state authorities have heard stories about a curious phenomenonnnOn days when the weather is hot batches of power generated in California are nsold to other states A little later in the day similar amounts of power are nsold back to California  but at much higher pricesnnThe question is is it the same power If so that could be megawatt nlaundering  a multicompany conspiracy to evade Californias wholesale nprice cap which covers power generated in California but not power sold into nCalifornia from elsewherennWorried that such transactions could be costing consumers millions of ndollars several energy specialists raised concerns about megawatt laundering nduring a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hearing a month ago in San nDiego And earlier this month state Sen Steve Peace DLa Mesa  who nhelped lead the push to deregulate electricity sales in California  nformally asked the commission to investigate the practice which he termed npotentially illegal market coordinationnnBut an unconfirmed news report last week said the federal agency had nconcluded that generators had not abused the market And others say concerns nabout megawatt laundering are exaggeratednnAmong them is Jan SmutnyJones executive director of the Independent Energy nProducers Association a powerfirm trade group and chairman of the nIndependent System Operator which oversees most of Californias power gridnnWhile acknowledging that such laundering is possible SmutnyJones said there nis no evidence it is actually occurring or is widespreadnnThis is one of those things thats turning into an urban legend he said nI dont want to characterize this as a significant problemnnEven some critics of the way power is purchased in California concede that nmost of what has been labeled megawatt laundering probably reflects nothing nmore sinister than the ability of some entrepreneurs to take advantage of a ngood deal when they see onennNonetheless they see evidence that at least some Californiaproduced power nis being sold out of and back into the state at a higher price And they nblame that on loopholes in the system that they say ought to be closed nbecause the transactions are helping to drive up the cost of powernnThe Independent System Operator invites this type of activity said Frank nWolak a Stanford economist who chairs the nonprofit corporations market nsurveillance committee which has warned of the potential for megawatt nlaundering in at least two reports this year The thing that makes all these nproblems go is the fact that the ISO has said Well pay whatever it takes nto keep the lights on and thats screwing consumers big timennIn 1998 when the states energy markets were deregulated it was generally nassumed that opening up the sale of electricity to competition would make npower less expensive As a precaution however officials at the Independent nSystem Operator instituted wholesale price caps which they lowered twice nthis summer to help keep a lid on costs On July 1 this year they reduced nthe cap from 750 per megawatt per hour to 500 one megawatt being nsufficient power for 1000 homes Then on Aug 7 they cut it to 250nnUnfortunately things havent worked out the way officials had hoped nWholesale prices rose dramatically this year And while a freeze on retail nutility rates has temporarily shielded Pacific Gas  Electric Co customers nfrom those soaring costs home electricity prices have tripled in San Diego nwhere a similar freeze already has come offnnIn the process some generators learned that all it takes to get around the nstates wholesale price caps is a basic understanding of how the market nworks One of the best ways to get top dollar they learned was to hold off nselling their electricity until the Independent System Operator issues what nis known as an outofmarket call for energy which amounts to an emergency nrequest for electricitynnFrom May through September this year the overall price of power in the state naveraged less than 125 per megawatt hour according to authorities But over nthe same period power sold in response to outofmarket calls averaged more nthan 430nnDuring the summer when energy use is at a maximum California typically nimports about onefourth of the power it uses from other states Since power ngenerated by firms in other states isnt limited by Californias price cap nthose companies generally are in a better position than California firms to nmake a killing on outofmarket sales But by cutting a deal with a ncollaborator in another state energy specialists say California generators nalso can profit handsomely  despite the capnnHeres hownnSay a California generator has 100 megawatts Instead of selling it in nCalifornia where the firm can receive no more than 250 per megawatt hour nunder the current cap it finds a utility an electricity broker or a ncorporate affiliate with an equal amount of power in another state such as nArizona Then  just before an expected heat wave in California which is nlikely to result in an outofmarket call for power here  it convinces the nother firm to do a tradennUnder the deal the California generator sends its 100 megawatts for one hour nto the company in Arizona where there is no price cap and earns 300 or nmore per megawatt  for a total of 300000 In return the Arizona firm nships its 100 megawatts for one hour here Since that power isnt subject to nCalifornias cap it earns perhaps 400 per megawatt  for a total of n400000nnPresumably energy specialists say the two firms then split the 100000 ndifferencennThe potential profit from such deals is considerable Generators in and out nof California received more than 110 million from outofmarket sales this nsummer according to the Independent System Operator But determining if nmegawatt laundering is really happening how often and who might be nbenefiting is difficultnnOne California investigator said authorities first suspected that megawatt nlaundering was occurring when they noticed that precisely the same amount of npower was being sold to another state and then sold back into California nminutes later But other experts said the evidence has rarely been that nclear While hundreds of megawatts is sold into and out of the state on any ngiven day they said the suspicion that firms were conspiring to sell the nsame power back and forth has stemmed largely from unfounded speculationnnOne big problem for investigators trying to learn if the system has been nabused is that confidentiality rules keep many of the details about these nelectricity transactions privatennEntities like us and others who may be suffering from the consequences of nthis laundering dont necessarily have the documents to prove it said Gary nStern director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison one of nthe states three main utilities We can only speculate based on things nweve heard from others about the practiceIts our hope thats one of the nthings thats being examined by the various federal and state agencies ninvestigating this summers extraordinary rise in California power pricesnnIndeed while some people say megawatt laundering can be substantially nlimited by ending the practice of paying more than the wholesale cap for noutofstate power others argue that its just as important to eliminate the nsecrecy surrounding electricity transactionsnnId like to see more information made public said Jim Bushnell a nresearcher at the University of California Energy Institute in Berkeley who nspecializes in analyzing the states energy markets There are a lot of nrumors circulating around this he said of megawatt laundering and it nwould help clarify if this is a serious problemnnnnnnTo see more of the San Jose Mercury News or to subscribe to the newspaper ngo to httpwwwsjmercurycom,1
bThis morning the FERC had its meeting to discuss events in California and  nthe FERCx01s response to them The following is a summary of the remarks of nthe  four Commissioners and the major points of what has been ordered nnMajor featuresnn1 Proposes to replace ISO and PX boards with independent  nonstakeholder nboardsnn2 Continued significant role for the presidents of PXISO who  should be nmade voting membersnn3 Elimination of mandated buysell requirement for the IOUs  although no nexplanation as to whether this requires CPUC action Overreliance  on spot nmarkets has been problematicalnn4 As an independent exchange the PX will be free to design the  products ndesired by the marketnn5 The proposed price modification measure will be a temporary  measure nSingle price for all offers below 150 However no bid above 150 will  set nthe price for all generators A seller can bid anything it wants Allowing  ngenerators to receive their asbid price will allow highcost generators to  nparticipate in the market However the generator will be required to nprovide  confidential reports to FERC explaining the necessity for bids over n150 through  123102nn6 The order requires forward scheduling of 95 of an scheduling  ncoordinatorx01s schedule with a penalty applied for deviations which exceed 5 nAs  an incentive the proceeds of the penalties go to the schedulers who ncomply with  the tolerance bandnn7 Rejects the purchase price caps proposed by the ISO The order  would neliminate the ISOx01s price cap authoritynn8 Beginning 1101 the prospect of refunds will be available  nnCommissioner HebertnnDue to a technical problem when I called in I heard only part of his  nremarks He announced that he will have a separate concurrence in the order nbut  is troubled by some of its features The 150 cap is questionable nwhether  described as a Soft cap or as a hard capnHis concern is that it will  clearly discourage new investment in generation nHe therefore recommended that  the 150 cap should be escalated on a regular nbasis perhaps every six months  until it reaches at least 250 nnHe points out that the ISO and PX are required to make RTO filings to FERC  non 11601 These filings should address the major aspects of the Order nissued  today nnHebert also questioned the issue of refunds alleging that it was  ndisingenuous to suggests that refunds were a possible remedy nnCommissioner Breathitt nnBreathitt announced almost all of the foregoing major points of the  orderThe norder is based on a market approach In choosing our marketbased  approach nit is our goal to guide the markets to selfcorrect and not  reinstitute ncommand and control regulation We have all worked too hard  too long to nhave this resultnnCommissioner MasseynnSixtyfive years ago the Congress decreed that prices had to be just and  nreasonable There is no exception for marketbased approaches He will  nconcur as the order does find that prices have been unjust and nunreasonable

bWhile I appreciate the virtue of flying below the radar if possible the nmatter here is complicated by the fact that FERCs discovery rules 18 CFR nSubpart D pertain only to proceedings set for hearing    and to such nproceedings as the Commission may order  18 CFR 385401  In this case nFERC stated that a trialtype hearing is not necessary     and nspecifically rejected the use of a trialtype evidentiary hearing  Slip nop at 4748  n97  Thus while I have not researched the matter as yet my npreliminary view is that the CPUCs attempt to invoke FERCs discovery nprocesses would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERCs Nov 1 order nand its regulations unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case  nThe CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it nspecifically attempts to equate paper hearings with trialtype hearings nsee page 1 of its MotionnnThe CPUCs motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery nin this case under Rule 401  While the CPUCs motion does not apply directly nto marketers FERCs ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or nsomeone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties  As a result we nneed to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to npresent our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing nwith an expedited decisional track particularly in light of the fact that nStaff has already conductednn Jeffrey Watkiss 110800 1031AM nDoes anyone have an idea as to why marketers including EPMI are not nincluded in

bTHE FRIDAY BURRITO nnBen Zycher from the RAND Corporation used the following line in his talk at nthe WPTF General Meeting in Phoenix a few weeks ago The story takes place in nthe good ol days of the Soviet Union when Brezhnev was Premier Brezhnev nand the rest of the Politburo one fine May Day were watching the tanks and nmissiles pass by the Kremlin Wall when Leonid noticed in the middle of the nparade a truck carrying a group of civilians He turned to Dmitri Ustinov nthe Defense Minister and asked Who are they Ustinov replied Those are nour economists You just wouldnt believe their destructive potential nnThis is appropriate for our time and our situation The economists descended nupon us when the California market was designed but we know not from where nAliens Since weaving conspiracy theories is a popular past time in nSacramento We just know they are gouging us them bullies I believe that none must do the same by following the money Im not talking about the ncampaign contributions in Gray Davis pocket The most money has gone from npower sales in California to the Canadian Province of British Columbia It nwas a plot the Canadians hatched I mean look at Governor Davis He looks nkind of BCish Skinny and lanky wimpy hair and a hesitation in his nspeech He talks their language a mix of misspelled French meet me at the ncentre English and Eh One night in 1996 the BC government secretly nsent us some economists by the truckload to destroy California The nutilities probably paid for the bus tickets I happen to know that Frank nWolak Chair of the ISO Market Surveillance Committee once lectured at a nUniversity in Vancouver BC What more evidence do you need The BC nGovernment sent us cheap hydro power sold at inflated market prices so that nthey could do what the citizens of California wanted to do with their budget nlargess x01 build roads schools and hospitals They didnt think we could nfigure out their plot but we did Now is the time for California to ncounterattack Well send them some of our politicians a bipartisan group nincluding a few who can add and some of our select energy thugs from the nCPUC and the Blind Oversight Board nnSpeaking of times and situations there was a time when discussing the ISO nwords such as communist and Nazi were only uttered by my pal Carl nImparato We would shake our heads and chuckle at Carls extremism We narent laughing now The descriptors seem to arise again and again in polite nconversation by a wider circle of people I watch with utter amusement nbecause the alternative is retching breakfast at the demagoguery of the ISO nGoverning Board the Market Despair Team the Governors office and some nmembers of the California Legislature Like an audience watching a tragedy nfrom hell we scream aloud These people are crazy And indeed they are nMr President is not helping us at all by continuing to wrangle over who gets nthe musical Chair at FERC x01 Bubba Curt or Bubba Patrick Listen to us Mr nPresident Let Bubba Curt keep the reigns for a year or two and let Bubba nPatrick take a seat at the table We need someone with a shockproof BS ndetector Someone who can honestly field a motion to dismiss the California nISO The time is long overdue to shoot this horse in the head nnNot all is evil This week in Houston the resource capital of California I nvisited the trading floor folks at Dynegy before attending the WTPF Board nmeeting The coolest thing I saw besides all the neat gadgets on each ntraders desk was the coffee machine Brother Jolly Hayden showed me how to nuse it You pick the type of coffee you want The contents of the coffee nare in a shotglass sized plastic tub with a foil top I picked Venezuelan n6 Decaffeinated Waxy Crude The tub is placed inside the brewing machine nand the start button is pushed Presto coffee drips from the spout into a nwaiting cup I asked Jolly How did the hot water get mixed into the ground nbeans He removed the tub from the machine and showed me a pin prick hole nmade in the foil top and another that was made at the bottom Is that neat nor what nnI would like to buy a brewing machine just like the Dynegy coffee machine nbut a little larger I would set up a booth in Sacramento on the corner of n11th and L and bark out to passing members of the Legislature Free space nshuttle Come and see life on other planets They would jump at the chance nto visit other planets I would seat them in the machine push the start nbutton and voila Dripping out would be the essence of democracy Dont nworry about the holes needed at the top and the bottom They are already nthere and quite enlarged nnBack to my day at Dynegy Trade floors might seem similar across companies nbut the small differences speak to the management style embraced by the crew nand its leaders Each electric trading desk for various parts of the ncountry is set up a little bit differently For example some desks have a nperson doing assetbacked trading but some dont When I arrived at 6 am nHouston time the Eastern desk was busy in its trade day The Western folks nhadnt arrived yet Later I sat with Randy LeForce of the Western desk nCaptain LeForce to you he told me He could talk big because Dave nFrancis who sits next to Randy and hangs witty quotes from the ceiling nabove his head Even a blind pig could make money in this market was on nvacation As the pace of the trading gathered steam Randy kept an eye on nall the different people working the Western trading desk The Captain nworked it like a maestro nnDuring my visit some Dynegy folks came up to me introduced themselves and nsaid how much they enjoyed the Friday Burrito Ill tell you what There nare few things in life that give me as much satisfaction Complete strangers nwho tell you that something you do makes them feel good well it doesnt get nany better than that Garrison Keillor the wellknown author of Lake nWoebegone Days and NPR radio entertainer once said a writer should have an naudience Not everyone in the world should be in the audience but an naudience nonetheless of some people I now know what he means And the npeople I met on the trading floor felt like they knew me and shared with me ntheir thoughts and opinions on a lot of things Often they asked me Are nthose California people really that crazy nnSince last week you might have noticed the pace at the FERC has picked up nsomewhat Last Friday the FERC issued an Order on possible refunds for nalleged overcharges by parties selling to the ISO last January That was nnews worthy Then on Wednesday the FERC issued an Order to remove barriers nto additional electric generation in the West The Order admits that it nwont change the dire situation in the West but these are steps in the right ndirection The FERC also issued on Wednesday a showcause order to AES and nWilliams regarding the maintenance of RMR units that were called by the ISO nin April and May of 2000 That is a serious case that we must watch nclosely Also this week the California Senate kicked off its own ninvestigation this will be the tenth such investigation of the California nmarkets to uncover alleged price manipulation The Senate Committee will nhave subpoena rights and if I understand it correctly they plan to subpoena nindividuals Sounds like a Kangaroo Court and a ThreeRing Circus to me nThursday Secretary Abraham stated in a congressional hearing that the West nwould certainly experience power outages this summer Finally an LA Times nreporter asked me if I had heard that a small QF company had filed for nseizure of SCE property to satisfy an outstanding debt That would be step none of the bankruptcy chacha All in all a typical week among crazy npeople nnLets see what else we can talk

nnLetters nnJobs and People nnOdds  Ends  n nnThings in the Peoples Republic of California n PUC Updates Utility Liabilities nnMy favorite regulator the California PUC issued an Order in the Utilities nRate Stabilization case to reopen the record on utility audits Although nthe text of the order is unremarkable the data tables bring up to date as nof March 8 the outstanding liabilities of PGE and SCE nnThe PGE commercial paper obligation due as of March 8 increased by 354 nmillion since January 31 for a total default amount of 790 million QF npurchases increased by 280 million for the same fiveweek period now ntotaling 651 million The ISO payments increased 934 million now totaling n15 billion and the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits nincreased 214 million now totaling 433 million PGEs total default namount is now 33 billion excluding amounts yet to be collected from PGE ncustomers for DWR purchases nnThe SCE balance is as follows The commercial paper obligation that is due as nof March 8 increased by 260 million since January 31 for a total default namount of 401 million SCE defaulted on a significant amount of longterm ndebt principal and interest roughly 249 million QF purchase defaults nincreased by 354 million for the same fiveweek period now totaling 835 nmillion The ISO obligations decreased 11 million and the direct access ncharge backs for negative PX credits increased 21 million now totaling 25 nmillion SCEs total default amount is now 17 billion excluding amounts nyet to be collected from SCE customers for DWR purchases nnThere is little question that the QFs are taking it on the chin big time nIn the last five weeks between January 31 and March 8 the defaulted npayments to the QF owners from both utilities has increased 630 million nThe total QF default for both utilities as of March 8 stands at 15 nbillion Does anyone wonder why 1500 MW of QF capacity has shut down in nCalifornia Without these payments being made very soon I would expect the namount of shut down QF capacity to easily double or more Why would these nprojects produce without the promise of being paid nnThings in the Peoples Republic of California n Be a Source for Energy Price Update nnArt ODonnell editor and associate publisher of the wellknown and widely nread California Energy Market CEM is looking for traders willing to nparticipate in his

general consumption The Friday report nalso features a brief story about natural gas markets in the West nnThe WPTF Board of Directors has allowed me to publicize this offering and to nexplain that if your company is interested in participating the information nyou provide to Art would be protected as confidential In Arts words The nprice survey is x01 unlike some attempts at creating a tradable index number neg McGrawHillx01s Power Markets Week index or the Dow Jones indices is nmore of a narrative about the state of the market d a pulse reading as nopposed to a blood pressure number or an EKG As such I do not ask traders nand schedulers for precise dollar figures or volumes associated with specific ntrades but rather questions like Whatx01s MidColumbia going for today What nabout offpeak How has that changed since this morning Oh yeah why is nthat Anything else I should know nnThe WPTF Board asked Art to explain how the information he collects would be nprotected since so many marketers and generators are under State data nsubpoenas Art replied The Constitution of the State of California nprovides for a blanket immunity against government intrusions for news ngathering from confidential sources and unpublished information something nwhich we believe in strongly at Energy NewsData Corporation and which we are nwilling to go to jail to protect So if for instance the Attorney General ntried to subpoena me or anyone from my staff about power price information nwe would 1 refuse to divulge anything other than the already published naccounts 2 send back a copy of the Constitution 3 contact the attorneys nfor the Society of Professional Journalists and 4 start preparing a benefit nparty to raise legal fees  nnIf you would like to participate in Arts survey please email him at naodnewsdatacom nnThings in the Peoples Republic of California n BPA Misquoted in the WSJ nnIn last weeks Burrito I referred to a Wall Street Journal article that nportrayed a BPA trader as admonishing the DWR for accepting bids over market nprices I was surprised when I received the following email from BPAs nDavid Mills His message to me copied a letter he sent to DWRs Ray Hart nexplaining what he meant as opposed to what he was quoted as saying nnDear Ray n nAs per our telephone discussion I just wanted to reiterate a few things nrethe Wall Street Journal article and the quotes attributed to me At no ntime during the interview with Ms Smith did I state that I thought that nCDWRs offers were out of line with the prevailing market price in California nor that your traders should check that price before entering the market The nreporter was quite interested in the price difference between California and nthe MidC price here in the Northwest and when I asked I told her that ncurrently that price delta was roughly 50100 MWhr with MidC being lower nthan the CA prices I did not indicate to the reporter that I thought that nCDWR was paying more than the California market price and was simply trying nto make a comparison of price relativity between California and the nNorthwest Lastly BPA has on occasion charged extraregional entities nless than the prevailing market price but has only done so to remain nconsistent with our own pricing strategies n nI apologize for any misconceptions or miscommunications that may have nresulted from this and look

these folks should we choose to go forward with the analysis  nHowever the goal is to produce a high level analysis ie deregulation nis good and can work command and control regulation is bad and we know that nit does not work  Once the study is released if it is pursued the nauthors could tour the country testifying before federal and state bodies nto advocate the virtues of deregulation and the pitfalls of reversing ncourse  The analysis would not be a debate over To Poolco or not to nPoolco PJM etc  In this way including folks like Joskow and Hogan could noffer the added benefit of creating

the group supporting the effort the greater the credibility and 2 nthey are asking for about 1 million to do the studynIf you think it would be useful to pursue the study as part of our national

whereby those who use more npower pay more than those who conserve The Chronicle has learned nSources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff nmembers to accept a socalled structured rate system nTop officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the nstate may end up spending more than twice the 10 billion previously nestimated to purchase power on behalf of Californias nearbankrupt nutilities nIf so the officials warned that consumers electricity rates could double nIn the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co this would mean customers naverage monthly power bills would rise from 60 to 120 nConsumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on nthe way nWere going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money said Larry nWebster a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City We might as well admit nthat electricity is no longer a nickel Its a dime If youre going to use nit nlets pay for it nSteve Maviglio a spokesman for the governor distanced himself yesterday nfrom estimates that rates would double The figures reported in the press he nsaid were wildly high nThe governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure n Maviglio said Until we know the results of the negotiations with the nutilities you cant conclude anything nThe state is negotiating a multibilliondollar bailout package with PGE and nSouthern California Edison Co to relieve the utilities of about 13 billion nin debt nPGE and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California ncan overcome its current energy woes without higher rates The irony of the nDavis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two ncompanies nThe state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall nsaid John Nelson a PGE spokesman Either wholesale prices need to come ndown or retail prices need to go up The disparity is too large nStatewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of Californias nenergy situation to ratepayers  and may have served as a blessing in ndisguise for the governor nCOST VS OUTAGESnIf given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates many nconsumers said they would accept increases in their power bills nI dont like either choice said Janet Leroux facing the possibility of a ngooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco ncandy store But I guess Id go with higher rates I sure didnt like the nblackouts nPublicly the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay nwithin the existing rate structure  a stealthy way of saying that nJanuarys 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year nwill remain in place nBut privately he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that ncould be spread over as long as 10 years sources said nUtility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a nminimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards nFor the good of California its inevitable said Gary Ackerman executive ndirector of the Western Power Trading Forum a Menlo Park energy industry nassociation nSacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the nCentral Valley this summer hed be more than willing to pay a higher price nfor power if this keeps the air conditioners on nIts like gasoline he said I dont like paying higher prices for ngasoline but thats the price of doing business nRatepayers draw the line though at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent nIf it was 20 percent Id probably do it said Tracy resident Mark nDougherty But if it was more like 50 percent Id rather go with rolling nblackouts nId rather have blackouts agreed Jenny Soghomonian owner of a shoe nrepair shop in San Franciscos Financial District I dont want to pay rates nthat are so much higher nNOT EVERY COST PALATABLEnThis is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find nthemselves walking While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid nblackouts they arent willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their nway nYet if rates are not high enough they may not prevent daily blackout threats nthis summer and beyond nHigher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation said Tom nHiggins senior vice president of Edison International parent company of nSouthern California Edison nSimply put he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve npower and thus alleviate shortages unless there is a financial incentive to ndo so nRebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response nrequiring critics say too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers nBut a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt nwidespread conservation measures nIt adjusts consumer behavior Higgins said People want to get their bills nback down nRATES EFFECT ON USAGEnHe and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way nCalifornians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the ngovernor  a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer nIts intellectually dishonest to think theres any other way out of this nHiggins said nConsumer activists initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes nacross loud and clear No no no nNo bailout No rate increases No secret deals said Harvey Rosenfield nhead of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica We nneed to get back to a regulated system nRosenfield is the biggest fly in the governors ointment He has threatened nto push through a ballot initiative reregulating Californias power market nif Davis cannot find a consumerfriendly way out of the current fix nBecause of Rosenfields past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance nrebates which delivered about 800 million to consumers his threat is taken nseriously in Sacramento nWeve paid too much already Rosenfield said A fair price is what we were npromised by deregulation which was a 20 percent rate decrease nHowever when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured nrate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governors staff nRosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric nBig users should pay more he said after a moments reflection Im open nto a tiered system but only if its fair nRosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer nadvocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with nDavis nMOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATESnClearly though momentum is building toward a system of structured power nrates which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers nThe California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address Januarys n9 percent rate increase on Tuesday That increase originally was given only a nthreemonth duration but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least nanother three months if not longer nPUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates ngoing up but added her voice to those backing a structured system nI am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation she said People nwho use a whole lot of power should pay more nThe biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself now that nCalifornia is purchasing power on behalf of its cashpoor utilities The nstate already has spent about 4 billion buying electricity and has yet to ndetermine how the cash will be recouped from consumers nSan Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its nenergy footing once more rates will probably be heading up That way you nhave more convenience and electricity more stability she said nBut Magee has come up with another solution one that doesnt involve rate nincreases and rolling blackouts nShes moving to Texas nChronicle staff writers Matthew Stannard and Pia Sarkar contributed to this

flawed effort that satisfies no onennIt fell short of the sweeping suspension of regional electricity deregulation nthat California officials and some energy experts had advocated But it also ncrossed what has become a firm ideological line among Republican leaders nincluding President Bush by imposing price controls on some electricity nsales to utilitiesnnUnder the agencys order which takes effect on May 1 California regulators ncan begin to impose price controls on power generators when electricity nsupplies fall to within 75 percent of consumer demand The state is expected nto face such shortages routinely this summer and the order has the potential nto shave billions of dollars off Californias electricity bill if implemented nfully some people at the federal agency saynnThe president has a longheld belief that price caps dont work the White nHouse press secretary Ari Fleischer said today The last thing you want to ndo is create artificially increased demand and put in disincentives that harm nthe availability of supplynnMr Fleischer noted that the energy commission is an independent federal nagency adding that the Bush administration has no authority to countermand nits ordersnnBut Mr Bush did appoint the commissions chairman Curtis L Hbert Jr a nRepublican Like the president Mr Hbert has often insisted that price caps ndo no good But he came under withering political pressure to abandon the nagencys largely hands off approach to the California crisis Some of that npressure came from the two other commissioners at the agency both Democrats nand Mr Hbert wound up voting for the controls adopted on Wednesday nightnnThe split with the Bush administration raises fresh questions about whether nthe president will seek to replace Mr Hbert as chairman in coming weeks nMr Bush has nominated two Republicans to fill vacant slots on the ncommission including Pat Wood a longtime ally of the president who served nas chief electricity regulator in Texas Industry executives say they expect nthat Mr Bush will eventually name Mr Wood to the commissions top postnnIn a reflection of how delicate the issue is Mr Hbert argued that the nagencys action did not amount to imposing price caps But his position nappeared to rest on a semantic distinction between returning to cost based nelectricity regulation as some Californians favor and the agencys decision nto impose tactical price controlsnnAmong California officials the dominant reaction was disappointment Some nstate regulators and market experts said the agency was practicing nupsidedown economics it has chosen to impose price limits during periods of nsevere scarcity when prices theoretically ought to rise to encourage ncompanies to build power plants and encourage people to use less electricitynnThe agency its critics argue has chosen to ignore price abuses during times nof relative abundance when power generators the critics say have used nartificial market power to earn high profitsnnThey got it exactly wrong said Frank Wolak chief market supervisor for nthe California Independent System Operator which runs the states power ngrid It looks like theyre doing something but it doesnt work in real ntimennMr Wolak has estimated that most overcharges by generators last year  in namounts that he puts in the billions of dollars  occurred when electricity nsupplies were not acutely short meaning that the agencys price caps would nhave had no mitigating effectnnThe state is likely to face many emergency shortages this summer But Mr nWolak said generating companies have become adept at gaming the system He npredicted that they would find ways to continue to earn high profits in nCaliforniannOne fear is that generating companies will arrange to sell their output to naffiliates out of state When Californias transmission grid managers nscramble to find supplies the same companies will offer to sell the power nback to the state but only above the cap price The agencys new order nincludes a provision that is intended to discourage this sort of abuse known nas megawatt laundering But the agency has a weak record of enforcing such nmandates and California officials are skepticalnnThe order also came under fire on other grounds The commission said that nprice caps would be canceled unless California submitted a proposal to link nits transmission grid to the one that serves the Western region a priority nof the agency that state officials have resistednnLinda Stuntz an electricity industry lobbyist who is an expert on the nagency called that clause bizarre arguing that it held the entire nCalifornia market hostage to a technical filing requirementnnCalifornia politicians said they worried that even if the price caps were ncarried out as promised relief would be too limitednnThe price limits will be based on estimates of the highest operating costs of nthe least efficient generating plant in the state The order as written means nthat companies that operate efficient generating plants could still sell npower at large markups during periods when caps are imposed When the agency nscrutinized the California market earlier this year it found the highcost ngenerators to be justified in charging about 300 a megawatt hour for nelectricity a price that is about 10 times as high as the state was paying nfor power a year agonnnnCopyright 2001 The

version of the following paper is available on my web page natnnwwwwhogancomnnnnON THE EXERCISE OF MARKET POWER THROUGHnSTRATEGIC WITHHOLDING IN CALIFORNIAnScott Harvey and William W HogannApril 24 2001nnEXECUTIVE SUMMARYnnBeginning in June of 2000 the shock of unexpectedly high prices in the nCalifornia electricity market convinced everyone of the need for policies to ncorrect the apparent market failures The public debate and policy ndiscussions have been dominated by a focus on market power as a principal nproblem amenable to regulatory solution However design of effective npolicies to moderate prices or mitigate their effects depends on the ndiagnosis of the underlying causes High prices attributable largely to an nexercise of market power in electric generation would point to particular nmarket participants and behaviors that could be targeted for regulatory naction By contrast high prices attributable to bad electricity market ndesign would indicate a need for changes in the design High prices nattributable to higher fuel prices environmental constraints and capacity nshortages on the other hand would prompt actions to address the cost of nfuel and environmental limitations and indicate that retail loads should nreceive the appropriate price signal for conservationnnSuppliers could affect market prices by strategically withholding some ncapacity in order to profit on the capacity actually sold in the market But ncharging high prices during periods of scarcity is not classified as nexercising market power if there is no strategic withholding of supply nLikewise refusing to supply without being paid is not an exercise of market npower Although the potential for withholding exists for many suppliers the nfocus of attention has been on the exercise of market power by thermal ngenerators in CaliforniannOn its face the experience of extremely high prices suggests that the nexercise of market power could be important But at the same time the data nshow that there have been profound changes in the California market such that nthe thermal generators have actually increased their production more than ndemand has grown If anything thermal generators that hit annual output nlimits produced too much rather than too little in the summer of 2000 nFurthermore the widespread impacts of higher electricity prices throughout nthe western market both on and off peak indicate that if the exercise of nmarket power is important it is occurring to an extent and through channels nunprecedented in this or other electricity markets In short this is a ncomplicated story and there is ample room for further investigation of the ndata and diagnosis of causesnnExamination of the major analyses of the exercise of market power reveals nthat the estimated magnitude of the possible strategic withholding of nelectric generation is small enough to make it important to verify the nsimplifying assumptions If strategic withholding were large and pervasive nthen the real details of the California electricity market could be ignored nBut it is by now apparent that the evidence is not clear and any finding of nthe presence or absence of strategic withholding of generation in the nCalifornia electricity market could turn on the simplifying assumptions used nin the analysis of the data For example annual limits on production ndictate that plants should not run in many hours when prices are higher than ndirect incremental costs hence examinations of output decisions for nindividual hours or months are necessarily incomplete The variation in real ntime conditions is large enough to produce significant reductions in output ncompared to the expectations given dayahead prices hence with capacity nconstraints average optimal production is necessarily less than optimal nproduction at average prices Limits on the ramping rate of generation nunits startup costs minimum load costs and other operational ninflexibilities imply that a dispatch day is not just twentyfour separate nhours and must be analyzed chronologically recognizing these factors And nso on Accounting for such effects can reverse the implications of the nprevious evidence Unfortunately the real details are neither simple nor nincidentalnnIt is difficult to conduct a study of market power based solely on publicly navailable data A fuller analysis would require data available only to the nCalifornia Independent System Operator and has not been done Many factors ncontributed to higher electricity prices in California and the market power ntheme is only at most part of the story The import of the previous nanalyses is not to prove that market power has been exercised in the nCalifornia electricity market but rather to suggest that it might be nimportant The import of the sensitivity analysis here is not to prove that nmarket power has not been exercised in the electricity market but rather nto suggest that it is unlikely to be the dominant factor and may not even be nsignificant With the available data in the public domain and the special ncomplications introduced by the California market design the margin of error nin estimating the extent of the possible exercise of market power through nstrategic withholding of electric generation is of the same order of nmagnitude as the effect being measured On balance to date the publicly navailable data provides no reason for the Federal Energy Regulatory nCommission to change its conclusion that there is no evidence of strategic nwithholding nor any proof that no strategic withholding has occurrednnBy contrast there is general agreement that the California electricity nmarket design is x01seriously flawedx018 Furthermore there is evidence that the npolicy responses that have been adopted in California have accelerated an nalready serious market collapse Hence without dismissing the possibility nof the exercise of market power the principal policy focus should be on nfashioning workable solutions for the other more serious problems in market ndesign that relate to the underlying causes of the market meltdownnnSeparate from market power mitigation California should pay its bills raise nincremental prices to retail customers and move as quickly as possible to noperating a coordinated and efficient market with consistent pricing for all nthat includes unit commitment dayahead scheduling and realtime nbalancing Although not a panacea these steps would address immediate nproblems and set the stage for longerterm initiatives to expand generation ncapacity transmission infrastructure and the reach of an efficient market nto the western interconnected gridnnnnnnnWilliam W HogannJohn F Kennedy School of GovernmentnHarvard Universityn79 John F Kennedy

BY PEGGY NOONANn Monday August 7 2000 426 pm EDTn The choice of Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as Al Gores running mate is son smart so clever so good so satisfying so striking that it just mayn turnn this election a bit on its head for a while Certainly its most immediaten effect is going to be a successful Democratic convention next week in Losn Angeles because now the Democrats badly hit by their own form of Clintonn fatigue and acutely aware of the particular charmlessness of theirn presidential candidate have something to cheer about They respect Joen Lieberman They think he has a center a moral and ethical view of then world He is experienced and articulate He is decent and intelligent Hen isn independent The media love him He is a regular costar on Imus and alln ofn the columnists and reporters for the elite newspapers and all of then electronic pundits and anchors know him and admire himn But that is not what is most wonderful What is most wonderful is that hen isn an Orthodox Jew What does this mean It means a lot of people who loven America more than they love parties or politics are happy that a big andn great breakthrough has occurred A friend a journalist who is politicallyn conservative and Jewish emailed me to tell me he had been weeping alln morning that hed cried when he heard the news Another friend an producer at a TV news show called and told me she woke her father inn California to give him the news and they both got choked up This is liken 1960 she said and I said I know and I got choked up It is wonderfuln when America is at her most American and breaks down another barrier andn says Whats in your heart is most importantn If Joe Lieberman had been Joe Lee and an Episcopalian Al Gore would haven been smart to pick him He would have been an obvious choice The onlyn reason he would have hesitated over Mr Lieberman is that hes Jewish Mrn Gore decided that was just fine I think that I have never seen Al Gore don such an elegant intelligent and original thing Well done Mr Goren I have to tell you this really does feel like a 1960 moment to me I wasn an little girl when a Catholic got chosen to run for president and I hadn gathered from the conversation of grownups that You Dont Elect Catholicsn to the Presidency When it happened its hard to describe how excitingn andn moving and idealisminspiring it was It gave a lot of people a lot ofn joyn It opened things up more That was a good thing So is thisn And because this is such a good thing I hope everyone of whatevern politicsn or persuasion sits back for a few days and feels good about it Everyonen should be nice and not do any political bashing until    Fridayn However I think its okay and maybe even helpful to note the followingn Network producers are going to decide in their bright and touchinglyn uninformed minds that the big opponents of the Lieberman choice will ben Christian conservatives Thats where theyll go for the negative soundn bites But Christian conservatives love Joe Lieberman Theyve been arm inn arm with him in the great cultural battles of the past decade He was justn about the only Democrat whod give them the time of day He was on theirn siden The last time I saw Mr Lieberman was last spring in New York at an symposium on Hollywood and the culture I moderated and introduced ourn guestsJoe Lieberman and Bill Bennett who are close friends andn cowarriors in the values battle Lieberman and Bennett very franklyn talkedn to the audience of producers and writers and network people and movien stars about how to make television and film and music more decent moren helpfuln This is how people on the right think of and have experienced Mrn Liebermanas a good guy with his head screwed on rightn Many conservative ChristiansI think most conservative Christiansseen alln of those who love God as part of the same cultural minorityn Conservativen Christians dont feel they have much in common in terms of theirn politicaln desires with atheists and agnostics and leftist Episcopalian bishops andn such But they think they have a great deal in common with Orthodox Jewsn They crowd around Rabbi Daniel Lapin when he speaks at a conservativen gathering they crowd around Dennis Prager Michael Medved David Horowitzn and scores of others One of the biggest heroes of conservative Christiansn is an Orthodox Jew called Dr Laura the last time I saw her she wasn wowing them at a bornagain Christian assembly at the National Prayern Breakfast last Februaryn A powerful and respected political officeholder told me Monday thatn theresn no upside to the Lieberman choice I told him theres no downside Hen was surprised and said He cant even campaign on Saturdays I said son what America would love to see a politician who actually put God firstn one day a weekn I wish Id added this Remember Sandy Koufax Joe Lieberman notn campaigning on Saturday is Sandy Koufax not pitching on Yom Kippur Theren were a lot of great sports moments in the 1950s and 1960s but nonen greater than the day in 1965 when Mr Koufax put God before the Worldn Series What a great guy what a lesson for a generation of Christian andn Jewish kids And Muslims and everyone else toon Yes its good news for Hillary Its great news for Hillary It enlivensn part of her New York base it says to New York Jews that the Democrats aren the party that did this great thing it excites peopleand may help themn forget or at least not remember so vividly that the Democraticn senatorialn candidate has shall we say a not fully satisfying relationship with Newn Yorks Jews A historic choice like the Mr Lieberman can overwhelm a lotn ofn previous bad staticn But lets not care about that for now The headline is not Is It Good forn Hillary The headline is It Is Good for America It is a wonderfuln country that does something like this that takes a good man who is an member of a small ethnicreligious minority to be one of its two majorn vicen presidential candidates and that greets that choice with resoundingn hurrahsn This is really a great day We should all be happy We really are an maturingn democracy,2

FRIDAY BURRITO nmore fun than a fortune cookie and at least as accurate nnEveryone is getting into the act When I started this gig I was the only nguy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry in nCalifornia I wrote about whatx01s new whatx01s happening and all the nimportant stuff This week Governor Gray Davis decided to write his own nBurrito His epistle got more press than mine but why is he muscling in on nmy turf Not to be outdone PUC President Loretta Lynch released a report nwhich looks into every facet of Californiax01s power business No stone left nunturned Ix01m telling you there isnx01t enough room in this business for all nof us They need to clear out nnWith people like Herr Hair Peace Governor Ix01mNot MrRogers Davis and nLetx01s Do Lynch who needs a Friday Burrito They redefine our reality each nweek with mindnumbing aplomb For example starting in early June the PX nwas ordered to compete for business against other Qualified Trading nVehicles Then two weeks later the Energy Fhrer legislated that idea to nan early death which kept the status quo for at least one year This week nthe PUC approved 5year bilateral deals for PGE and SCE thereby opening the nPX to competition and emasculating the PXx01s Block Forward Market Zip bam nboom nnI canx01t wait to see what next week will bring I hear Senator Bowen is nholding Committee hearings on re regulating the industry and the Governorx01s nnew Energy Security Council will meet to decide six things nnWhatx01s for lunch nWho will sit at the head of the table nDoes anyone have good seats for next weekx01s Democratic convention nIs there anyone we havenx01t indicted yet in the power industry nWho will crank up the air conditioning in this room Itx01s getting too warm nnThen they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena ignore nthe facts and publish a report It makes one want to take a deep breath nand inhale the scented fumes of democracy nnYou know I canx01t think about where to begin so letx01s start somewhere nnThings on the Island of California n Is there anyone left at SDGE with a brain n The PUC issues its scathing report n The ISO invokes 250 price caps Duh nnThings at the throne of FERC n Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order nnOdds and Ends  nnThings on the Island of California n Is there anyone left at SDGE with a brain nnWell the answer very clearly is no I have been astounded by repeated nattempts of SDGEx01s most senior people to ape humans but instead they mimic napes nnConsider the following First they waltz their default customers into the nsummer with little of no protection from price spikes in the wholesale nmarket Forgivable in that it is human to err The prices skyrocket in nJune and they start looking for who to blame x01Must be them damn nindependent generatorsx018 say their managers Gary Cotton informs the ISO nGoverning Board that hedging SDGEx01s position in the Block Forward Market nwouldnx01t have made any difference Therex01s one nobel laureate who missed his nprime nnNext under pressure they ask for help from suppliers and anyone else who nwill assist the utility and their customers Nine offers show up at their ntable and they canx01t choose any of them Again Mr Cotton tells his fellow nISO Governing Board members that these things take time and we donx01t to rush nsince there are many legislative barriers and well the surfing was good nthis week so why spoil it nnNow they are in a panic because the Energy Fhrer is visiting old ladies nliving in trailer parks advising them not to pay their SDGE electricity nbill and to continue to operate their air conditioners SDGE puts a full npage ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that SDGE is doing neverything it can to lower their electric bills including asking the ISO for na 250 price cap but the public can help by calling the ISO address and nphone number provided in the ad and urging them to lower the cap I always nthought the location of the ISO was a State secret for security reasons No nsecrets in San Diego nnBut we are not done No sir we are not Those buffalo heads who run that ncompany decide they will win a gold star on their collective foreheads and nimplement one of the four resolutions passed by the Electric Oversight nBoard The one they pick is to petition FERC on an expedited basis to cap at n250 the price at which sellers may bid energy or ancillary services into nthe ISO and the PX The primary reason is that Western power markets are not nworkably competitive In other words they want FERC to set a max price on nwhat generators can sell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO can nbuy nnWhat I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDGE continues to ncollect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must run energy into the nPX These are sales from their stranded assets Their grief hasnx01t abated ntheir greed nnSo to recap SDGE missed the boat on price hedging failed to win consumer nconfidence in public meetings asked for help from suppliers and did nothing nin response then filed at FERC to cap the sale price because the wholesale nmarket into which they sell overpriced energy is not workably ncompetitive Too much time in the direct sun light nnThings on the Island of California n The PUC issues its scathing report nnThe PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spent enough ntime I only read the Executive Summary and that only because our counsel nDan Douglass forwarded me a copy Let me pick out some of the gems in nPresident Lets Do Lynchx01s burrito I would recommend reading the whole text nif you have time and if you seek perverse entertainment nnx01California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply and npricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past ten years nnx01 Since June wholesale prices for electrical power in California have nincreased on average 270 over the same period in 1999 resulting in over 1 nbillion in excess payments for electricity nnx01Hot weather aging power plant and transmission infrastructure and ndysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combined to ndrive prices up  nnx01Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity npurchasers of California power will likely pay billions more in electricity ncosts this year Moreover these price increases do not necessarily fund new ninvestments in electricity supply or delivery reliability  they may flow nsolely to power producer profit margins nnx01Despite the Electricity Oversight Boards legislative mandate to oversee nthose institutions we have been unable to obtain bid data Nevertheless n  we believe enough evidence of questionable behavior exists that the nAttorney General should conduct an investigation into these statewide market npractices coordinating with other State agencies including the PUC and the nEOB Such an investigation would provide the factual foundation that nCalifornia policy makers and regulators need to recover any illegally nobtained profits nnx01A momentous consequence of Californias attempt to create a market in nelectricity is that the federal government now regulates Californias nelectric system Washington DC now controls pricing decisions directly at nthe wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and to the extent nthat supply incentives are correlated to prices Washington DC now affects nCalifornias ability to attract new investment in power plants nnx01Past administrations willingness to cede the States authority to the nfederal government combined with the legislative creation of two nonpublic nsupervisory organizations that have no duty to protect the public or consider nthe retail customer The Independent System Operator ISO and the Power nExchange PX the nonprofit private corporations that operate the States ntransmission system and control wholesale pricing policies are governed by nboards whose members can have serious conflicts of interest Some of these nboard members or their companies financially benefit from higher prices in nelectricity markets Neither of these private organizations is accountable to nthe State or its consumers  n nnx01Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the States electric nservices the State of California should protect its businesses and consumers nfrom cartel pricing collusive behavior inadequate power plant maintenance nand lack of market planning for adequate electricity supplies nnx01California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance  as San nDiegans did not this summer  how and when the price of an essential service nlike electricity will double California is now largely constrained by nfederal mandates from providing comprehensive retail price relief as long as nwholesale prices remain so high If California tried to reimpose a price nfreeze in San Diego now federal regulators would likely prevent that naction  Shortterm price relief however cannot resolve market gaming nor fundamental wholesale pricing problems controlled by federal regulators nnx01We have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know if the ISO nand PX failed to detect manipulation and gaming on several fronts We do not nknow how market players acted in price offering and bidding and scheduling nThe FERC has just announced an inquiry into national pricing and energy nmarket issues California should not wait for national findings before it ninvestigates California market practices We recommend that the California nAttorney General immediately subpoena relevant records and data to determine nthe pricing and offering behavior of market participants the actions of the nISO and its board members and the actions of generators in supplying nCalifornias energy needs nnx01Ten Actions to Consider or Act Upon to Prevent Current Electricity Problems nFrom Spreading in 2001  n n 2 Create a California Energy Council modeled on the National Security nCouncil to unify State action to resolve energy problems and to perform nintegrated energy planning nn3 Ask FERC for extended wholesale price cap authority to moderate California nwholesale market pricing nn4 Ask FERC to recognize the defects in the California and western regional nmarkets and find that no competitive market

write a Burrito anymore The Democrats in nSacramento are doing that for me Welcome comrade nnThings on the Island of California n The ISO invokes 250 price caps Duh nnIt is really hard to describe the drama of an ISO Governing Board meeting nespecially when our favorite topic arises It seems the only time the Board nbecomes animated is when one of three issues are on the agenda price caps nFTRs and priorities for software enhancements Otherwise its pretty much nhumdrum nnx01Round and x01round we went once again A few more forced votes tipped the nscale in favor of the cap There were 15 yes votes which included a forced nyes vote from our friend Jerry Toenyes by order of Secretary of Energy Mr nRichardson Jerry did you realize that the last letters of your name could nbe rearranged to spell x01NO ET YESx018 Kind of a french thing Ix01m sorry nabout that vote Jerry You still go in my book as one of the brave and bold nfor standing up to that sort of intimidation for so long Your picture in nthe SF Chron said it all nnThe brave souls who stood tall and voted NO included David Parquet Enron nJan SmutnyJones IEP Barbara Barkovich CLECA Caolyn Kehrein CMA Dan nKirshner EDF and Stacy Roscoe Procter  Gamble Now I must admit that nDynegyx01s Greg Blue did help by voting a Texas No spelled x01ABSTAINx018 nI have instructed Dynegy trader Dave Francis in Houston to work with Greg to ncorrect that problem Wex01re going to work things out nnThe Energy Fhrer addressed the Board again I didnx01t mind that I only had na few brief very brief moments to address the Board and Herr Hair Peace ngot over 20 minutes That didnx01t bother me at all He did more damage to nhimself in 20 than I could do in 2 He blasted away at everyone who opposed nhim He pined about Camden quitting the Board He said he knew how prices nand markets work that it isnx01t the way those academic egghead FERCloving neconomists tell you who pray to the gods of competition He lambasted WAPA nfor withholding generation to protect fish and wildlife what was that all nabout He predicted that on Thursdayx01s PUC meeting he and all the other npowerful Democrats Republicans and angry citizens of San Diego would demand nthat the PUC impose a rate cap on retail electric rates in San Diego that are njust and reasonable it didnx01t happen And on and on and on This man is nvery delusional He believes that Steve and only Steve Peace can save the nworld He believes that political will trumps judicial quasijudicial or nindependent Board actions This man makes relevant all the abstract musings nof the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche 18441900  The will to power the nbermensch the transvaluation of values etc nnBut we are getting under uber his skin with the help of the press nWednesday afternoon I called Commissioner Dick Bilas to see if he thought nwhether the next dayx01s PUC meeting was going to be a roll over Dick said he ngot a call from Peace and that Peace said he would not come to the meeting nApparently Peace had received a lot of press and all of it bad nnThatx01s the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one step away nfrom our front door nn Things at the throne of FERC n Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order nnAnd now the good news You deserve this FERC gave the California market a nlittle wiggle room last Friday FERC issued a last minute reply to the ncomplaint by Morgan Stanley Capital Group relating to the ISOx01s intent to nlower the price cap FERC denied the complaint but they didnx01t waste time nwith an Order to simply deny a complaint FERC danced on the head of the ISO nand pulled the bite out of the price cap nnHere are some excerpts nnx01We accepted this Amendment 21 not because it was a cap on sellersx01 prices nbut because it would promote order and transparency in the market by clearly ntelling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing to pay and allowing nsellers to make informed economic choices on whether to sell in the ISO nmarket or to sell elsewhere nnx01  The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than nany other buyer of these services  If the ISO is unable to elicit nsufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling because ngenerators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose it will have to raise nits purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs  Therefore nan increase in outofmarket OOM calls for generation may be necessary to nmaintain system reliability Because the current payment for OOM is not nsubject to a maximum purchase price the resulting overall payments may be nhigher nnx01To the extent the  ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing a ndirective that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets under nany circumstances eg when system load exceeds 38000 MW such a nrequirement is not permitted by our  Order and the ISO tariff  Future nimplementation of the ISO Board resolution with regard to a requirement to nsell would require significant revisions to the ISO market rules Such nmarket changes could not become effective absent a corresponding amendment to nthe ISO tariff which would have to be filed under section 205 of the FPAx018 nnWell What do you think about that nnJust wait Here is what the sleeping bear Commissioner Hebert said in his nconcurring remarks nnx01Getting to the bottom of the problem in my view requires us to begin a nproceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of the nCalifornia grid The record supports such a move  A memorandum to the nISO from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing board eloquently nbrings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine the independence of nthe ISO The memorandum also thoughtfully outlines consequences to the nmarkets of a return to x01command and controlx01 nnx01Because these allegations come from a nonmarket participant especially nshould we take heed We must also take notice of the public pressure on the nBoard to compromise its independencex018 nnAmen brother amen nnOdds and Ends  nnAs you can imagine this week like an endless string of weeks before this nhas been interminable I get about three phone calls a day from press nreporters very little of which ever sees print My shtick is just too ncomplex for casual readers But I do notice that the reporters are asking nbetter questions The public is becoming more savvy The information flow nis moving in our favor and will disarm the forces of evil in about 10 nyears nnI have other problems on my mind I am working on a new computer system nReally itx01s just an upgrade of an older computer that is a bit faster than nthe laptop I tried to upgrade very unsuccessfully As a result of the all nthe new hardware and software I purchased my office looks like a war zone nwith an odd mix of PUC service copies computer documentation and diskettes nlaying all around Quite a mess nnPrepare for the future Our next general meeting is scheduled for Thursday nand Friday October 5 and 6 at Moro Bay Barb Ennis will prepare a blurb for nus in next weekx01s Burrito about room reservations timing golf etc Our nguest speakers will include MSC Chairman Professor Frank Wolak who will talk non the subject of his choice Ms Irene Moosen of Grueneich Resource nAdvocates who will make a presentation on the distributed generation case nbefore the PUC and William Freddo of PGE National Energy Group who will ngive us some education on operating a power plant inside the New England ISO nnNow for your daily bread provided this week by Dan Douglass Last week we nhad a joke about Catholics This week itx01s agnostics n nAn atheist was taking a walk thru the woods admiring all that the accident nof evolution had created What majestic trees What powerful rivers What nbeautiful animals he said to himself nnAs he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes nbehind him As he turned to look he saw a 7 foot grizzly bear charging ntowards him He ran as fast as he could up the path He looked over his nshoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him He tried to run even nfaster so scared that tears were coming to his eyes His heart was pumping nfrantically as he tried to run even faster but he tripped and fell on the nground He rolled over to pick himself up and saw the bear right on top of nhim raising its paw to kill him nnAt that instant he cried out Oh my God And time stopped The bear froze nThe forest was silent The river even stopped flowing A bright light nshone upon the man and a voice out of the sky said You deny my existence nall these years teach others I dont exist and even credit my creation to na cosmic accident and now do you expect me to help you out of this npredicament Am I to count you as a believer nnThe atheist ever so proud looked into the light and said It would be nrather hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all these nyears but could you make the bear a believer nnVery well said the voice And the light went out the river flowed the nsounds of the forest continued and the bear brought both paws together nbowed his head and said Lord I thank you for this food which I am about nto receive n nnAmen And have a great weekend Oh and thanks to all of you who sent me nhappy birthday wishes It was very much appreciated nnKSB ngba,3

thenextraordinary run up in prices for wholesale electric energy and ancillarynservices accompanied by deteriorating service and reliability In SannDiego electric customers bills have more than

similar prospects as their legislated ratenfreeze periods come to an end In San Francisco we saw rolling blackouts fornthe first time in our historynnAs soon as the dimensions of the crisis became evident I directednCalifornia regulators including the Public Utilities Commission and thenElectricity Oversight Board and the Independent System Operator to takenimmediate steps to identify and

AnalysisnDepartment and the Market Surveillance Committee of the CalifornianIndependent System Operator reach the same conclusions Subsequent behaviornof wholesale electric prices during August confirms their conclusions andnsubjects California to further economic damage While I remain hopeful thatnCalifornia wholesale markets may ultimately become competitive and becomencapable of serving the interests of consumers and the public I cannot andnwill not accept the liabilities to California that result from the currentnsituation for even a short period I intend to take any and all stepsnnecessary to restore economic stability to the electric serviceninfrastructure of CaliforniannFERC bears the responsibility under its organic act to assure just andnreasonable wholesale electric rates FERC bears responsibility to ensurenthat a workably competitive market exists before California consumers andnCalifornias economy are subjected to unconstrained marketbasednelectricity prices Consequently I renew my prior request that thenCommission act with utmost speed to intervene to the fullest extent possiblento restore wholesale prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that havenresulted from the exercise of market powernnnnOFFICE OF THE GOVERNORnnnA00245nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEnSeptember 12 2000nnGOVERNOR DAVIS NAMES KAHN CHAIR OF THE GOVERNORS CLEAN ENERGY GREEN

difficult times  I believe that you are sincere man andnknow that you must be broken hearted but I hope that this article can helpnyou lead a dispirted workforce to see things more clearly  My wife ShellynPierce has worked for Enron for the past two years and like many of yournemployees has lost a great deal of her life savings  Of course I acceptnmost of the blame for this for reasons related to this article  I lost myninvestment discipline and held out the false hope that Enron could notnfalter  After reading the article to her while I was out of town Inbelieve that her spirit was a bit rejuvenated and she was ready to face thenchallenges that lay before younnMr Lay I appreciate the opportunity that you have given my wife and ournfamily and hope that this story inspires you to regain your successesnnnFrom the USA Today Tuesday November 27 2001 page 15AnnIn recession face brutal facts thrivenBy Jim Collinsnn    A man in his early 20s recently asked me So whats a recession likenIts an entirely alien concept to him hed grown up during the greatestneconomic boom in modern memory  His question drove home the fact that wenhavent faced a severe protracted economic setback for nearly 2 decadesnleaving us terribly unpracticed at dealing with tough timesn    With this recession  long in coming perhaps long to stay  nownofficially upon us it is imperative that corporate leaders relearn a keynlesson about how great companies and great people deal with difficultntimes differently from how they deal with merely good ones  That lesson isnthe Stockdale Paradox a peculiar psychology shown by those who emergenfrom tough times not just intact but strongern    Adm Jim Stockdale was the highestranking US military officer in thenHanoi prison camp during the Vietnam War  Tortured many times during hisn8year imprisonment Stockdale lived without any prisoners rights no setnrelease date and no certainty as to whether he would ever again see hisnfamilyn    He shouldered the burden of command while fighting an internal warnagainst his captors and their attempts to use the prisoners for propagandanAt one point he beat himself with a stool and cut himself with a razorndeliberately disfiguring himself so that he could not be put on video as annexample of a welltreated prisoner  He exchanged secret intelligenceninformation with his wife through their letters knowing that discoverynwould mean more torture and perhaps death  After his release Stockdalenbecame the first threestar officer in the history of the Navy to wear bothnaviator wings and the Congressional Medal of Honorn    You can understand then my anticipation at the prospect of spendingnpart of an afternoon with Stockdale who happened to be at the HoovernInstitute across the street from my office when I taught at Stanford  Innpreparation I read In Love and War the book he and his wife wrote tonchronicle their experiences those 8 yearsn    As I read the book I found myself getting depressed  It just seemednso bleak  the uncertainty of his fate the brutality of his captors  Andnthen it dawned on me  Here I am sitting in my warm comfortable officenlooking out over the Stanford campus on a beautiful Saturday afternoonnIm getting depressed reading this and I know that he gets out reunitesnwith his family and becomes a national hero  If it feels depressing fornme how on earth did he deal with it when he was actually there and did notnknow the end of the storyn    I never lost faith in the end of the story Stockdale said when Inasked him  I never doubted not only that I would get out but also that Inwould prevail in the end and turn the experience into the defining event ofnmy life that in retrospect I would not traden    I didnt say anything for many minutes and we continued the slow walkntoward the faculty club Stockdale limping and arcswinging his leg stillnstiff from repeated torture  Finally I asked Who didnt make it outn    Oh thats easy he said  The optimistsn    The optimists  I dont understand I said completely confusedn    The optimists  Oh they were the ones who said Were going to benout by Christmas  And Christmas would come and Christmas would go  Thenntheyd say Were going to be out by Easter  And Easter would come andnEaster would go  And then Thanksgiving and then it would be Christmasnagain  And they died of a broken heartn    After another long pause he turned to me and said This is a verynimportant lesson  You must never confuse faith that you will prevail innthe end  which you can never afford to lose  with the need for disciplinento confront the most brutal facts of your current reality whatever theynmight ben    My conversation with Stockdale had a profound influence on me but Innever really considered it a business lesson until my research team begannto wrestle with the question of why some companies rise from difficulty tonbecome great while others emerge from those exact same difficultiesnweakened and dispirited  We found that companies that became greatnembraced a corporate version of the Stockdale Paradoxn    Fannie Mae for example found itself in the 1982 recession losing 1Mnevery business day with 56B in loans under water  Many analysts thoughtnFannie Mae which was getting 9 on its mortgage portfolio but paying 15non the debt it issued was doomedn   But CEO David Maxwell and his team never wavered in their aim to notnmerely survive but also to prevail as a great company  Yes theynconfronted the brutal fact that the interestrate problem was not going tonmagically disappear certainly not by Christmas  But they used this grimnfact as a catalyst for creating an entirely new business model based onnasking three central questions of greatnessn        What can we potentially do better than any other company in then        worldn        What can best drive our economic enginen        What best ignites the passions of our peoplen    Instead of reacting to the recession with mindless restructuringnFannie Mae rebuilt itself based on its answers to these questionsnEventually it generated investor returns nearly eight times those of thengeneral stock marketn    When asked how he dealt with the nay Sayers and the analysts who wrotenFannie Mae off Maxwell said that it was never an issue inside the companynOf course we had to stop doing a lot of stupid things but we nevernentertained the possibility that we would fail   We were going to use thencalamity as an opportunity to remake Fannie Maw into a great companyn    The sad truth is that most executive teams wont respond that way tonthese dark days of uncertainty  Instead of using this recession as annopportunity to fundamentally rethink their business and rebuild a culturenof discipline the will simply restructure lay off a bunch of people andnliquidate their cultural equity  Mediocre leaders will hold out falsenhopes for a quick fix only to watch those hopes be swept away by eventsnTheir companies will begin to die of a broken heartn    It need not be this way  Those who lead with the Stockdale Paradox nthose who retain the unwavering faith that they will find a way to prevailnin the end but who also retain the discipline to confront the most brutalnfacts of reality  will find this an ideal time to rebuild and reinforcengreatnessnn    Used correctly this recession can be a defining time in your firmsnhistory that  in retrospect you would not trade  Used wrongly thisnrecession will weaken your foundations and make it that much harder tonbecome great  The choice is yoursnnn    Jim

repeatednattempts of SDGEs most senior people to ape humans but instead theynmimic apesnnConsider the following  First they waltz their default customers intonthe summer with little of no protection from price spikes in thenwholesale market  Forgivable in that it is human to err  The pricesnskyrocket in June and they start looking for who to blame  Must benthem damn independent generatorsO say their managers  Gary Cottonninforms the ISO Governing Board that hedging SDGEs position in thenBlock Forward Market wouldnt have made any difference  Theres onennobel laureate who missed his

resolutions passed by thenElectric Oversight Board  The one they pick is to petition FERC on annexpedited basis to cap at 250 the price at which sellers may bidnenergy or ancillary services into the ISO and the PX  The primarynreason is that Western power markets are not workably competitive  Innother words they want FERC to set a max price on what generators cannsell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO can buynnWhat I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDGEncontinues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must runnenergy into the PX   These are

you have time and if you seek perversenentertainmentnnCalifornia is experiencing major problems with electricity supply andnpricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past tennyearsnn Since June wholesale prices for electrical power in California havenincreased on average 270 over the same period in 1999 resulting innover 1 billion in excess   payments for electricitynnHot weather aging power plant and transmission infrastructure andndysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combinednto drive prices up nnBecause of serious market defects and tight supply of electricitynpurchasers of California power will likely pay billions more innelectricity costs this year Moreover these price increases do notnnecessarily fund new investments in electricity supply or deliverynreliability  they may flow solely to power producer profit marginsnnDespite the Electricity Oversight Boards legislative mandate tonoversee those institutions we have been unable to obtain

other Statenagencies including the PUC and the EOB Such an investigation wouldnprovide the factual foundation that California policy makers andnregulators need to recover any illegally obtained profitsnnA momentous consequence of Californias attempt to create a market innelectricity is that the federal government now regulates Californiasnelectric system Washington DC now controls pricing

deserve this  FERC gave the Californianmarket a little wiggle room last Friday  FERC issued a last minutenreply to the complaint by Morgan Stanley Capital Group relating to thenISOs intent to lower the price cap  FERC denied the complaint butnthey didnt waste time with an Order to simply deny a complaint  FERCndanced on the head of the ISO and pulled the bite out of the price capnnHere are some excerptsnnWe accepted this Amendment 21 not because it was a cap on sellersnprices but because it would promote order and transparency in the marketnby clearly telling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing tonpay and allowing sellers to make informed economic choices on whether tonsell in the ISO market or to sell elsewherenn  The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energynthan any other buyer of these services  If the ISO is unable tonelicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase pricenceiling because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choosenit will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meetnits needs  Therefore an increase in outofmarket OOM calls forngeneration may be necessary to maintain system reliability  Because thencurrent payment for OOM is not subject to a maximum purchase price thenresulting overall payments may be highernnTo the extent the  ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing andirective that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO marketsnunder any circumstances eg when system load exceeds 38000 MW suchna requirement is not permitted by our  Order and the ISO tariff nFuture implementation of the ISO Board resolution with regard to anrequirement to sell would require significant revisions to the ISOnmarket rules  Such market changes could not become effective absent ancorresponding amendment to the ISO tariff which would have to be filednunder section 205 of the FPAOnnWell What do you think about thatnnJust wait  Here is what the sleeping bear Commissioner Hebert said innhis concurring remarksnnGetting to the bottom of the problem in my view requires us to beginna proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of thenCalifornia grid  The record supports such a move  A memorandum tonthe ISO from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing boardneloquently brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine thenindependence of the ISO The memorandum also thoughtfully outlinesnconsequences to the markets of a return to command and controlnnBecause these allegations come from a nonmarket

bnLast night Linda and I spent a fairly long time with Leon Lowery Chairman Bingamans chief electricity advisor to discuss our concerns with the transparency and marketbased rate language  while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regardnnWe made progress on transparency less so on marketbased ratesnnOn transparency Leon understands our concerns  In a nutshell he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transactionspecific tradespecific information  We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language although he initially said details would be left to FERC  We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided it MUST be only in aggregate form  We also impressed on him that if as he said the intent is to leave details to FERC  then more of the details should be left to FERC not set by statutennLeon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections  This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff  Sam Fowler th chief counsel is a drafting sticklernnOthers should obviously weigh in and review this but to facilitate internal comments we need to get back to Leon today here is my take on what he has in mind  Under new sec 218b to be added to the FPA by bill sec 413 pg 13 under information required we would rewrite paragraph 2 as followsnn2  each broker exchange or other marketmaking entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commercennThe effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy  By leaving it as aggregate statistical information this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes etcnnAs to the timely basis of information release subsection c the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day  If we can restrict this to aggregate data question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily  That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want I think  Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leewaynnc TIMELY BASIS  The Commission shall require the information required under subsection b to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriatennThe change is to add appropriate so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable  The use of appropriate is what came to mind  perhaps there is some other word or phrase like consistent with  or promote competition or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability  There should be some valid purpose established before data is released  I would argue that the d language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure not when disclosure is appropriatennPlease let me have your thoughts although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the HillnnWill provide a further report on marketbased rates  In sum Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue but asked for our ideas and further arguments  We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets  His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets  We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer  nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down  Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron  but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets,6
bnnAttached for review and comment is a draft set of talking points on the Barton RTO discussion draft  I went through the testimony at the recent hearing and parsed the legislative language of the discussion draft  You will see that the talking points are designed to respond to two basic points being raised by our opponents 1 that FERC is rushing and being heavyhanded and 2 that the only interests involved are those of the transmitting utilities ie no mention of discrimination as being what RTOs will remedynnPlease let me have your thoughts in the next few days  Once Capitol Hill is up and running again we will distribute the final talking points to our consultants and to membersstaff of the Barton Subcommittee as we continue our efforts against the discussion drafts treatment of RTOsnn ,6
bSee NERC memo below that was just received  They have scheduled what they hope will be the final meeting to resolve the reliability legislation next week  August 9th  Of course this is awfully presumptuous in that it assumes that the model to be worked off of is the NERC model even the shortened one and not the PJM model that others prefer to use  We need to decide whether we suggest any changes to the shortened NERC version even those we know they would not take just to show a willingness to offer specific comments as we promised at the last meeting or simply agree to disagreenn Forwarded by John ShelkNAEnron on 08022001 0509 PM nnnDavid Cook DavidCooknercnetnerccom on 08022001 050614 PMnSent bytownerrlcnerccomnTotrlcnerccomncct nnSubjecttrevisions to reliability languagennnReliability legislation coalitionnnI have attached a memo outlining the edits that NERC would make in then719 discussion draft  My memo does not take account of the suggestionsnthat have been circulated in the last day or so  Ive also attached anmarkedup version of the 719 draft indicating our changesnnI propose that we meet in Washington on Thursday August 9 at 1000nam with the goal of coming to closure on reliability legislation thatnis shorter and less detailed than the language in the pending bills butnthat still preserves the essence of an industry selfregulatorynorganization  I am working on a location and expect to provide thatninformation tomorrownnI know that scheduling this meeting may be difficult for some and thatnschedules are already full but schedules will become even morendifficult later in the month  I take as our deadline having newnlanguage for the Hill during the August recessnnThank you in advance for your continuing efforts to bring this new modelnfor reliability into existencennDavid CooknGeneral CounselnNERCnoffice  6094528060ncell     6099153063ndavidcooknercnetnn Edits to 719 discussion draftdoc  Discussion draft 071901 dncncommentsDOC n  Edits to 719 discussion draftdoc n  Discussion draft 071901 dnc commentsDOC ,6
bnFollowing up on last nights email here are some specific suggestions to strengthen the draft EPSA letter on the Barton RTO draftnnThe second paragraph and the first few bullets after it should be rewritten as follows to make it clear that the current legislative proposal on RTOs is far off the mark as opposed to being fixed by technical corrections as the draft letter now statesnnYou have identified RTOs as critical to the development of a wellfunctioning transmission system and we wholeheartedly agree  We commend you for including all transmissionowning utilities in the RTO provisions and for requiring that transmission be conducted on an openaccess basis  However to accomplish the RTO and transmission goals we share it is essential that any legislation on RTOs not slow down the process already underway at FERC  Unfortunately the discussion draft as issued on October 9th does not meet this test  Specifically the proposalnnEstablishes a lengthy and cumbersome process that will delay the formation of RTOs by imposing procedural requirements that advantage those who oppose properly functioning RTOs including evidentiary hearings and court appeals review under standards of judicial review not normally applicable to Federal Power Act cases  nnRemoves the ability of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC to deal with an evolving marketplace by statutorily freezing market and operational structures in place as of date of enactment regardless of changed circumstancesnnrest of the bullets as in the draft letternnWe appreciate the opportunity to offer these suggestions to strengthen the draft letter  Please call with any questions or comments before the Legislative Affairs Committee meeting tomorrow  ThanksnnJohn,6

that nArthur Anderson had changes to the Xonon Technology Implementation Agreement ndesigned to make clear ENA had no primary or secondary obligations under the nXTIA The principal change suggested by AA  the deletion of the last nsentence of the BOLD language in Section 22  removed the obligation for ENA nto pick up any obligations under the agreement owed by West LB in excess of nthe Cap Note that this same change applies in the Agreement in Principle nrelated to the purchase of turbines nnXTIA Revision 4G  AAs change did not appear to address comprehensively the nprinciple AA espoused ie clarifying ENA had no primary or secondary nobligations under the agreements After much discussion and some nconsideration I decided to prepare alternative markups of the XTIA  one nthat attempts to meet the AA directive while preserving a level of comfort nfor GE I attempted this by increasing the limit on West LBs liability in nArticle 10 to 20 million from 99 million so that GEs recourse against nWest LB is the same as it had against West LB and ENA in the prior drafts nand by obligating West LB in the default provisions to pony up for an ENA ndefault I also extensively modified the Section 22 language  taken nverbatim from the LM 6000 deal  to eliminate the limited recourse provisions nfavoring West LB and in doing so made it easier to conclude that references nto ENA in the agreement are references to ENA acting in an agency and not nits individual capacity This notion is still pretty vague in the revision nbecause I did not want to create too much discomfort in GE since ENA nexplicitly acting in an agency capacity would mean there was no recourse nagainst it  since ultimate recourse would lie with the principal West LB nRoger suggested I delete the limit on ENAs liability in Article 10 to remove nthe implication it had any which I did  and which means we have no upside nprotection if we are construed to have obligations under the XTIAnnThe upshot is that in my opinion the 4g revision goes as far as possible ntoward placating AA while still retaining a possibility of selling it to GE nThe sheer number of changes required by the substance of AAs comment nhowever is bound to be disconcerting to GE at this stage of negotiations nparticularly when GEs expectation was for a  markup incorporating the new nbusiness terms agreed yesterday afternoon calling for payment of the nDevelopment Funds to be completed by September 302000 with the possibility nof a refund of a portion of the Development Fund Payment if the December 31 nMilestone is not timely completed and some clean upsclarificationsnnNote that in both revision 4g and 4ga Section43 now provides that the Xonon ncredit created is only exercisable by CCSI on and after December 312000 so nthat the credit amount can reflect the deduction of any Milestone 4 refund namount paid by GE if it does not complete that Milestone on time I think the ndollar value of the credit should be adjusted downward if a portion of the nDevelopment Funds paid on September 30 are in fact refunded in December We nneed to make sure to make provision in the Acquisition and Development nAgreement that any Milestone 4 refund received by West LB is paid over to nENA since West LB will have been repaid its advances on September 302000nnXTIA Revision 4GA  This alternate revision to the XTIA takes a minimalist napproach and incorporates only the new business terms some minor clean nupclarifications and the AA change to Section 22 and the change to Article n10  to remove a cap for ENAs laibility suggested by Roger It seems to me nit does not address meaningfully the AA admonition that ENA may not have nprimary or secondary liability under the XTIA if it wants to stay outside of nthe rigors of FAS 9710 However it has the singular advantage of looking a nlot like what GE and West LB expect to see in the revisionnnOption Repurchase Agreement This revision was complicated by the possible nrefund of the a portion of the Development Funds by GE if it failed to ncomplete Milestone 4 by December 312000  an attempt to retain some naccountability for GEs performance given that it is being paid for that nMilestone on September 30 to satisfy CCSI  Because the option repurchase nmust occur on or before September 30 it isnt clear what will happen nDecember 31 so its hard to figure out what to pay if the contract is not ncancelled by September 30 or what the credits are worth on that date nnSince CCSI is the direct recipient of the credits under the XTIA I first nthought ENA could hang onto  21 million  the amount formerly allocated to nMilestone 4 before its payment obligation was collapsed into Milestone 3 by ndeducting the refund from the amount payable  to CCSI on the option nrepurchase date and leaving CCSI to bear the risk of GEs repayment of any nrefund in order to make CCSI whole If GE did meet the Milestone on time and nso did not pay the refund amount directly to CCSI I thought ENA could always nmake CCSI whole by paying the 21 million  in December when the refund nmatter was decided That approach subtracting the refund amount from the nSeptember 30 payment to CCSI was decidedly unsatisfactory since the option nrepurchase formula could result  depending on the Milestones paid on the noption repurchase date  in a negative payment to CCSI for the option nnWhat I settled on in this draft was to go ahead and pay CCSI the amount of nthe premiums it has paid to September 30 plus 200000 if the turbine ncontract has not been cancelled on September 30 This would include repayment nto CCSI on September 30 of premiums paid by CCSI under the spark spread on nSeptember 30 Assuming CCSI made all its premium payments and West LB made nall of its Development Fund advances ENA would have received 99 million nfrom CCSI by September 30 paid out 99 million plus interest to West LB by nSeptember 30 and purchased the spark spread from CCSI for 101 million If nthe turbine contract is not cancelled but GE has to pay the refund I think nthe 21 million ought to go to West LB or its designee ENAnnIf we cancel the turbine contract and do not go forward with Pastoria the ndollar amount of the credits vested in CCSI  and exercisable after December n312000 are equal to the Development Funds advanced less the refund amount  nSince the document now reads that the 21 refund amount goes back to West LB nor its designee if GE pays the refund and CCSI is holding a  Xonon credit of nonly 78 millionit seems to me it will be necessary  to pay the refund over nto CCSI instead of ENA in order to make up for the fact that it paid 99 in npremium and only received 78 in credit in September This quick nliquidation of 21 of the credit seems to be an ancillary benefit to CCSI noccasioned by GEs refund We could provide in the agreements that GE makes nthis payment directly to CCSI or we can continue to have the right to receive nthe payment from GE under the XTIA and the obligation to pay it to CCSI under nthe Repurchase Agreement,6

request  Comments welcomennnThe President after a good deal of study and soul searching decided not to nsupport mandatory controls on carbon dioxide CO2 emissions from power nplants as part of a multipollutant clean air strategy   His decision was nbased on some very important factors  the nations energy markets are nexperiencing unprecedented supply and price challenges that any CO2 mandate ncould exacerbate and US regulation of CO2 in the nearterm could be nilladvised because the Kyoto protocol on global treatment of greenhouse gas nemissions is unworkable in its current form  nnI was somewhat concerned that the message sent by the Bush administration nwould polarize the debate over how the US should treat CO2 emissions in the nlong term as his statement did provoke a very negative antienvironment nreaction by many concerned individuals and organizations  Because this is an nimportant issue to all parties on all sides of the debate I believe that the nadministration should convene an ongoing process to carefully examine global nclimate change and all the longterm economic scientific and social impacts nof action regulate CO2 emissionsnnThe Presidents position on CO2 notwithstanding Enron continue to be a nprivate sector leader in offering real solutions towards reducing greenhouse ngas emissions in a rapidly expanding energy market  We are wellpositioned nthrough our experience with lowcarbon fuels for electric generation natural ngas and wind in particular our focus on new power generation and ntecnologies our leadership position in promoting efficiency through Enron nEnergy Services energy outsourcing business and our expertise in emissions ntrading and risk managementnnA multipollutant appraoch to reducing power plant emissions makes a lot of nsense from and environmental and energy policy standpoint  Enron will ncontinue to work with the Bush administration and Congress toward structuring na program that can achieve environmental goals while providing incentives to nbuild cleaner more efficient generation promoting a broad mix of fuels and ntecnologies and giving industry the flexibility and economic incentives to nmake reductions in a marketbased costeffective way  If were able to make nmeaningful reductions in 3 pollutants  NOx SO2 and mercury  and we do it nin a way that promotes efficiency and new technology well make progress on nCO2 whether it is regulated or notnnIn the meantime I will remain active in the global climate change debate to nposition Enron as a constructive player in the public policy arena and as an nindustry leader in promoting marketdriven solutions to the worlds energy nand environmental problemsnnnn Forwarded by Rob BradleyCorpEnron on 03222001 0555 PM nntRosalee Flemingnt03222001 1116

viewpoint on this issue is not to regulate carbon dioxide nemissions from coalburning power plants I also understand he based his ndecision in large part due to a recent Department of Energy report
