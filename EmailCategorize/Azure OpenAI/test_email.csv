FeliciaThis is a merchant asset which we currently own 100 but plan to sell down in the coming months  It absolutely has separate HR functions from Enron  they do not participate in Enron benefits and we are working hard to prevent any claims that we could be a joint employer with it  ThoughtsMichelle    Enron North America Corp  From  Felecia Acevedo  ENRON                           11022000 0856 AM To Michelle CashHOUECTECTcc  Subject Re Privileged and Confidential communication to my attorneys  Michelle  who is GSP  Are they a legal entity  Are they on our payroll  If they are we filed EEO1s for them    Below is the criteria to file an EEO1 reportStandard Form 100 must be filed by A  All private employers who are 1 subject to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 with 100 or more employees EXCLUDING State and local governments primary and secondary school systems institutions of higher education Indian tribes and taxexempt private membership clubs other than labor organizations OR 2 subject to Title VII who have fewer than 100 employees if the company is owned or affiliated with another company or there is centralized ownership control or management such as central control of personnel policies and labor relations so that the group legally constitutes a single enterprise and the entire enterprise employs a total of 100 or more employees B  All federal contractors private employers who 1 are not exempt as provided for by 41 CFR 6015 2 have 50 or more employees and a are prime contractors or firsttier subcontractors and have a contract subcontract or purchase order amounting to 50000 or more or b serve as a depository of Government funds in any amount or c is a financial institution which is an issuing and paying agent for US Savings Bonds and Notes All multiestablishment employers ie employers doing business at more than one establishment must file 1 a report covering the principal or headquarters office 2 a separate report for each establishment employing 50 or more persons 3 a consolidated report that MUST include ALL employees by race sex and job category in establishments with 50 or more employees as well as establishments with fewer than 50 employees and 4 a list showing the name address total employment and major activity for each establishment employing fewer than 50 persons must accompany the consolidated reportAll forms for a multiestablishment company must be collected by the headquarters office for its establishments or by the parent corporation for its subsidiary holdings and submitted in one packageFor the purposes of this report the term parent corporation refers to any corporation which owns all or the majority stock of another corporation so that the latter stands in the relation to it of a subsidiaryThe OFCCP has always held that subsidiary companies that do not have direct govt contracts must comply with AAP regulations if the parent company or other subsidiary companies benefit from government contracts  Their line of thought is that the subsidiary without government contracts benefits indirectly from the contract as well   If GSP is completely free standing and they do not participate in Enrons benefits abide by our policies or procedures  participate in our bonus process that may partially or wholly be funded by Enron Corp  etc they may have some type of argement not to comply  but I doubt it  If we own them over 51 I dont see a way they could not file EEO1s and have an AAP  We do all the AAPs in Corporate so if this is a freestanding Business Unit I need to know ThanksFeleciaMichelle CashECT11012000 0749 PMTo Felecia AcevedoCorpEnronEnroncc  Subject Privileged and Confidential communication to my

michellecashenroncom davidoxleyenroncom peterdelvecchioenroncomcc davidhoweenroncom franmayesenroncom Subject Privileged and Confidential communication to my attorneys     Michelle and Peter we GSP have determined that we are not a federal     government contractor  Based on feedback from GSP employees we do     sell newsprint to printers who print material for the federal     government but we are a secondtier contractor not a firsttier     contractor  Pat McCarthy the local employment law attorney that I     have been using used these terms when David Howe and i talked to him     today  Pat informed us that secondtier contractors do not have to     abide by all the federal government requirements for contractors     Based on this GSP does not plan to file EEO1 reports or prepare     affirmative action plans  In addition we do not feel that we are     subject to an OFCCP audit     Michelle since you left me the voicemail telling me that we are not     included in the Enron EEO1 i assume that also means that Enrons     status as a government contractor does not force us to prepare EEO1     and AAPs     Please advise us if you feel we have made incorrect assumptions on any     of this     Hoyt,1
Late tonight the Barton Subcommittee passed an energy policy package without any electricity provisions other than those related to conservation on a bipartisan vote of 291  The subcommittee approved an amendment by Mrs Wilson to conduct a national assessment and inventory of possible renewable energy projectsDuring consideration of the bill several amendments of interest and concern to Enron were offered and withdrawn they are likely to be offered when the full Energy and Commerce Committee meets to consider the package next Tuesday and Wednesday  The amendments in this category are1 Mr Waxman has an amendment he called the blackout and price gouging prevention amendment that would require FERC to modify its June 19 price mitigation order within 15 days of enactment to impose costofservice based rates with a rate of return of 15 percent if an entity is found to be withholding power from the grid during an emergency  The costofservice rates would thereafter apply to all of the offending entitys sales in the Western US  Several of us were rounding up opponents to the amendment when it was clear he was going to offer it and before he decided to withdraw it until full committee  We will continue those efforts before the full committee vote2 Mr Ganske has an amendment on net metering that he said would promote wind in Iowa and other renewables he may wait until an electricity bill rather than full committee on this bill3 Mr Shadegg has an amendment to exempt natural gas pipelines from the requirements of the National Registry of Historic Places  He said that currently this process holds up much needed pipeline expansions that are FERC approved4 Mr Waxman has an amendment that would require the President to develop and implement a plan to achieve the greenhouse gas reductions called for in a UN agreement that President George Bush 41 agreed to in 1992 reducing these emissions to 1990 levelsChairman Barton indicated that the Subcommittee will take up an electric restructuring bill either later this month or early in September depending on how long it takes to process this first energy package in the full committee and in the full House,1
